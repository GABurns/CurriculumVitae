Summary
National variety evaluation schemes for ryegrass assess the performance of varieties for several traits that can improve animal productivity. Calibration models were developed using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess (in vitro dry matter digestibility (R2 = 0.86), water soluble carbohydrate (R2 = 0.96) & crude protein (R2 = 0.98) concentration and buffering capacity (R2 = 0.95). An assessment on the effect of species, maturity, ploidy and age of sward on ryegrass varieties was carried out for each of the four traits as well as dry matter concentration and herbage yield. Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards had 21 % higher herbage yield than perennial ryegrass, however perennial ryegrass has significantly higher digestibility. The effect of sowings, ages of sward and blocks had on the varietal ranking was assessed, with the aim of developing an optimal sampling protocol. Such a protocol would require replication in sowings, ages of sward and block to account for the variation that exists in these factors. NIRS discriminant models were successfully developed to characterise samples to specific groups (Species, ploidy, maturity, age of sward, harvest year, cut, variety). The implications of these results were discussed in relation to the productivity and efficiency of farming enterprises.
 

CHAPTER 1


1	INTRODUCTION
 

1.1	Introduction
National ryegrass variety evaluation schemes seek to identify grass varieties that are suited for ruminant-based production systems that operate under appropriate practical management, and in local climate and soil conditions. Only a select few, that represent the most elite performing varieties, are eventually recommended for use in Irish farming enterprises. Recommendations are primarily based on seasonal and annual herbage yield, persistence and, to a lesser extent, nutritive quality (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). 
Within the Grass and Clover Recommended List of Varieties for Ireland (DAFM, 2012) three ryegrass species are evaluated: perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam..) and hybrid ryegrass (Lolium boucheanum Kunth). These account for the majority of grass species sown in Ireland, with perennial ryegrass the dominant species comprising approximately 0.95 of seed sold in Ireland (DAFM, personal communication) and 0.78 – 0.86 in Northern Ireland (Gilliland, et al., 2007). Italian and hybrid ryegrasses account for the majority of the remaining seed sold.
The ranges in growth characteristics and nutritive quality of these ryegrass species enable the end-user to select a combination of species and varieties that are suited to their farming enterprise and environmental conditions. Perennial ryegrass is suited to ruminant-based production systems in temperate climates due to its high yield potential and nutritive quality (Camlin, 1997; Wilkins, 1997) and persistence under grazing (Tallowin, et al., 1995). These traits contribute to its potential to reduce feed costs (Finneran, et al., 2012) and its majority contribution in reseed mixtures (Rath and Peel, 2005). Italian ryegrass is a short lived perennial grass that has a higher primary growth yield than perennial ryegrass but its annual yield declines in the years following sowing (Gilliland and Mann, 2001). Hybrid ryegrasses have been artificially produced through grass breeding programmes with the aim of combining the complementary characteristics of early growth of Italian ryegrass with the higher persistence of perennial ryegrass (Thomas and Humphreys, 1991). They are often included in seed mixtures recommended for silage production to increase yield (Lovatt, et al., 2010).
The agronomic quality of ryegrass is difficult to define as swards may have several functions (e.g. grazing, conservation or both) and ultimately forage quality is expressed through animal productivity rather than simply indices measured in the laboratory (Casler, 2000; Humphreys, 2005; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). These self regenerating swards are harvested several times within a year (Camlin, 1997), and a loss in productivity or nutritive quality at one harvest may be compensated for at a later harvest (Gilliland, 1997). Consequently, grass quality needs to be assessed throughout the growing season if a balanced overall judgement is to be made on a variety.
A major role of grass is to support animal production and its nutritive value is fundamental to fulfilling this requirement. The inclusion of nutritive quality traits into variety evaluation schemes will enable the end-user to select varieties suited to the requirements of their farming enterprise that will maximise the productivity and efficiency of their system.
In vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) has been cited as the single best indicator of nutritive value (Casler, 2000; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003) as it influences both grass intake and energy availability (Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). Thus, for example, Casler and Vogel (1999) reported an average 3.2 % increase in live weight gain by beef cattle per 1 % increase in grass digestibility. 
Water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration has attracted the attention of grass breeders and a sufficient increase in its concentration can increase forage intake and improve animal productivity (Humphreys, 1989a; Humphreys, 1989b; Humphreys, 1989c). Miller, et al. (2001) reported an additional 2.7 kg daily milk yield when a perennial ryegrass variety with an additional 39 g WSC/kg DM rather than a control variety was supplied to late lactation heifers.
Crude protein (CP) concentration in grass is a major source of nitrogen for protein synthesis requiring efficient digestion by microbes in the rumen. In grazed swards, perennial ryegrass CP concentration is relatively high among forages and is invariably above the threshold of 80 g CP/kg DM required for rumen function (Coleman and Moore, 2003).
Conservation of ryegrass (e.g. as silage) provides the opportunity to fill seasonal gaps in feed availability (O'kiely and Kaiser, 2005). However, despite the widespread use of silage making on farms, insufficient attention is paid to the ensilability properties of grass varieties in variety evaluation schemes (Conaghan, et al., 2008c). Both WSC, the primary source of fermentable substrate during ensilage, and buffering capacity, which indicates the amount of fermentation acids and thus of fermentable substrate required, combine to provide such information (Buxton and O'kiely, 2003)
The use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has been established as a rapid and cost effective method of analysing the nutritive and ensilability quality of forages (Shenk, et al., 1979) and has facilitated the widespread assessment of nutritive quality in both grass breeding and evaluation programmes (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Givens, et al., 1997; Humphreys, 2005). As NIRS is a secondary technique that relies on the use of calibration models to relate spectral data to values obtained by standard laboratory techniques, a number of chemometric techniques and strategies are applicable with no one approach being universally optimal (Geladi, 2003; Givens, et al., 1997; Stuth, et al., 2003). 
Near infrared radiation interacts with the atomic bonds in forages producing a spectrum  that contains information on their underlying chemical composition (Cen and He, 2007; Deaville and Flinn, 2000). This has lead to near infrared spectrum being referred to as a ‘fingerprint’ of the sample (Baranska, et al., 2006). The chemical composition between key characteristic groups differs, thus the information contained within the spectrum provides the potential as a tool for discriminating between taxonomic characteristics of a plant such as species or variety within a population.
The use of NIRS as a taxonomic tool remains a relatively novel use of the technology. Consequently, there are only a few published studies, which include the classification the species from wood samples (Schimleck L.R., et al., 1996) and also for the varietal classification of winter wheat varieties (Miralbés, 2008).This is despite NIRS being widely used for the quantitative evaluation of ryegrass samples (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Roberts, et al., 2003).
National variety evaluation schemes assess the agronomic potential of varieties over a number of environments (e.g. location and year(s)). The use of appropriate statistical analysis is a requirement to obtain information on the genotype x environment interaction and within- trial error (Smith, et al., 2005). It also enables an assessment of varietal stability to environmental change, allowing identification of varieties that are stable over a number of environments or varieties suited to specific environmental conditions (Smith, et al., 2005). Thus it is an important facet for evaluation schemes to assess genotype x environment interactions to provide a reliable estimate the agronomic value of varieties (Conaghan, et al., 2008a).
The statistical design and analysis of evaluation schemes should be as accurate, efficient and informative as possible (Smith, et al., 2005). A well designed and evaluated trial can obtain similar information using fewer resources than a poorly designed trail. For example, Casler (1999) reported that the sowing of a second trial at an single location, when harvested for one year, was a more effective strategy for the precision (as assessed by standard error) of varietal ranking than collection of three years of data from a single trial and more so on a per unit cost basis. If similar information from variety evaluation trials can be obtained from less resources this enables theses resources to be allocated to additional aspects, including;
i	a greater number of varieties to be assessed, 
ii	additional traits of interest to be assessed and/or 
iii	additional resources for evaluating other species.

2	LITERATURE REVIEW
 

2.1	Introduction
Ryegrasses are from the genus Lolium of the family Poaceae, which contains eight naturally occurring species. Two of these species; perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) are of agricultural importance (Jung, et al., 1996). Hybrid ryegrass (Lolium boucheanum Kunth) is an artificially bred species with the breeding objective of combining complementary characteristics of Italian ryegrass and perennial ryegrass (Thomas and Humphreys, 1991). Ryegrasses provide an important role in providing feed, forage and fibre to underpin modern ruminant-based agricultural systems in many temperate climates.
In Ireland ryegrasses are primarily utilized as forage in ruminant-based production systems and provide most of the metabolic and nutritional requirements to sustain growth and produce animal products (e.g. milk, meat) (O'donovan, et al., 2011). The growing season in Ireland is highly seasonal and ryegrass production does meet animal requirements throughout the year, with a forage deficit in the winter months (O'donovan, et al., 2010; O'kiely and Kaiser, 2005). Conservation techniques (e.g. ensiling) ensure the continuous availability of feed throughout the year (O'kiely and Kaiser, 2005).
The Irish national variety evaluation schemes for these three species assess the relative agronomic performance of a large number of varieties, within species, and select the most elite performing varieties that are eventually recommended for use in Ireland. These recommendations are primarily based on seasonal and annual herbage yield, persistence and, to a lesser extent, nutritive quality (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). 
Evaluation schemes and breeding programmes have a limited availability of resources to achieve their objectives. Thus the optimal allocation of resources and use of appropriate statistical techniques can maximise the efficiency of those resources (Smith and Kearney, 2002), which can allow additional genotypes to be analysed and/or make available resources for the analysis of additional traits of interest.
This literature review provides an overview of national variety evaluation schemes for ryegrasses and assess the role the nutritive quality of grass has on ruminant productivity and efficiency. It will focus on the role near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has had on implementing nutritive quality traits into national variety evaluation schemes and breeding programmes and the future potential of this technology. This review will focus predominantly on perennial ryegrass, reflecting the importance of this species in grassland production systems in Ireland.
2.2	Agricultural importance of ryegrass
Perennial ryegrass is the dominant forage species in ruminant-based production systems in both terms on seed sale and land area covered in north-western Europe, New Zealand and the temperate regions of Japan, Australia, South Africa and South America (Burgon, 1997). In Ireland almost 80% of agricultural land is permanent grassland with perennial ryegrass the dominant species in the majority of swards (Rath and Peel, 2005). Perennial ryegrass seed sale accounts for approximately 0.95 in Ireland (DAFM, personal communication) and 0.78 – 0.86 of seed sold in Northern Ireland (Gilliland, et al., 2007) with the majority of the remainder either Italian or hybrid ryegrass. 
Perennial ryegrass is suited to many intensive ruminant-based production systems in temperate climates due to its high yield potential, persistency under grazing (Tallowin, et al., 1995) and high digestibility (Wilkins, 1997). These traits contribute to its potential to reduce feed costs (Finneran, et al., 2012) and its majority contribution in reseed mixtures (Rath and Peel, 2005). Italian ryegrass is a short lived perennial grass that has a higher primary growth yield than perennial ryegrass with a decline in annual yield potential in the years following sowing (Gilliland and Mann, 2001) and is recommended for use in short term leys (2-4 years) for silage production systems (Camlin, 1997). Hybrid ryegrasses have been artificially produced through grass breeding programmes with the aim of combining the complementary characteristics of early growth of Italian ryegrass with the higher persistence of perennial ryegrass (Thomas and Humphreys, 1991). They are often included in seed mixtures recommended for silage production to increase yield (Lovatt, et al., 2010). 
2.3	Physiology and morphology of perennial ryegrass 
It is well established that an individual perennial ryegrass plant usually has at most three active leaves. When the fourth leaf begins to emerge the oldest leaf begins to wilt and die (Robson, 1973). The leaf appearance rate of perennial ryegrass varies throughout the growing season; in April a new leaf will emerge every 15 days, to once every 52 days between October and February (Vine, 1983). This has important management implications for maximising the productivity and nutritive quality of the sward, as when senescence begins to occur, the dead material at the base of the sward is of little nutritive value to the grazing animal and as such these resources have effectively been wasted from an animal production perspective.
  
Throughout the growing season the grass plant develops from a vegetative to reproductive state (development stage) which has a major influence on the chemical composition and nutritive quality of  the sward (Beever, et al., 2000). The plant usually reaches the pinnacle of maturity in late-May (heading date), where the plant produces seeds heads (Aldrich and Dend, 1963). As the plant approaches this heading date there is an increase in cell wall content (Figure 2.1) which is associated with an increase of lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose; the major components of the cell wall (Van Soest, 1994). A decrease in protein, lipids and minerals is seen with increasing maturity however there is an increase in non-structural sugars. 
2.3.1	Seasonal productivity 
Ireland has a mild maritime climate that is particularly suited for grass production systems. The north Atlantic current buffers Ireland from the colder winters that occur in places of a similar longitude (e.g. Moscow). Grass growth models by Brereton (1995) estimate between 11t DM/ha in the north of Ireland to 15 t DM/ha in the far south (Figure 2.2). (O'donovan, et al., 2011) reported figures for average annual grass production from Moorepark, Co. Cork report 14.0 t DM/ha with a range of 11.0 – 18.6 t DM/ha. The further south in Ireland the longer the grazing season, with the season beginning up to three weeks earlier in the far south than northern parts (Figure 2.3). The majority of grass growth occurs between April- August months (0.4) with little to no growth (0.1) occurring in November – January. 
 
Figure 2.2: Grass growth model estimates of the dry matter yield (t/ha) in Ireland from Brereton (1995).
 
Figure 2.3: Model estimates of the first day of the grazing season in Ireland fromBrereton (1995).
2.3.2	Ploidy
All naturally occurring Lolium species are diploid; that is they have two homologous pairs of chromosomes (2n = 2x = 14) (Nair and Cooperative, 2004; Smith, et al., 2001). Grass breeding programmes have artificially induced tetraploidy using colchicine (Wilkins, 1991) that doubles the number of homologous pairs of chromosomes (2n = 4x = 28). This has been viewed as a major advance in grass breeding as the resultant tetraploid varieties are potentially of increased productivity and nutritive quality (Camlin, 1997). 
The induction of tetraploid affects both the physiology and morphology of the plant. The doubling of the homologous pairs of chromosomes results in tetraploid plants tending to be larger than diploids, this is be due to a increased leaf elongation rate and leaf elongation time that results in the mature cells of tetraploids being larger than diploids (Sugiyama, 2005). The cells of tetraploid varieties are on average larger than diploids (25% longer, 12% wider) without a proportional increase in cell wall material (Wilkins, 1991; Wilkins and Sabanci, 1990). Tetraploid perennial ryegrass varieties have displayed a decreased cold tolerance than diploid varieties. This can be partially attributed to the increased water content of tetraploids allowing them to be more prone to freezing water (Sugiyama, 1998). 
Tetraploid varieties have a higher competitive ability than diploid varieties (Sugiyama, 1998) and this was thought to be due to the larger seed size of tetraploids; varieties have an increased seed size (Gilliland, et al., 2007) and weight (2.4mg vs. 3.8mg;(Smith, et al., 2003)). This provides additional resources allowing for faster seedling growth providing an early competitive advantage (Smith, et al., 2001). However Sugiyama (1998) found no significant differences in competitive ability between the ploidies in the first year after establishment with significant differences in the second year. This would suggest that seed size is not the only factor in determining the competitive ability of the ploidies, as if seed size was the casual factor in determining completive ability differences would be displayed in the first year after establishment. 
These physiological and morphological adaptations of tetraploids are of potential agronomic benefit. Tetraploid varieties tend to be higher yielding and of a increased digestibility than diploid varieties (Sheldrick, 2000). The increased nutritive quality of tetraploid varieties is attributed to the higher cell contents:cell wall ratio; thus tetraploid varieties have proportionally more intra-cellular space for cellular components such as WSC, protein and lipids that are of higher nutritive quality than cellular wall material (e.g. lignin, fibre) (Nair and Cooperative, 2004).
However, the proportional decrease in cellular wall material in tetraploid plants results in less structural support. This means tetraploid plants are often more prone to poaching by grazing animals and tend have a lower persistence than diploid varieties 
Balocchi and Lopez (2009) attempted to asses preference of grazing cows to either diploid or tetraploid varieties. Preference was assessed using eight lactating dairy cows following afternoon milking which were let out to the swards and a visual assessment made of which variety they were grazing. Over the three years of the experiment a greater preference for tetraploid varieties was displayed. 
2.3.3	Maturity
The maturity of an individual grass variety reflects the relative advancement from a vegetative to a reproductive state and this is associated with physiological and morphological adaptations that influences the productivity and chemical composition of the sward (Van Soest, 1994).
The Irish national variety evaluation scheme divides perennial ryegrass varieties into three maturity categories (early-, intermediate- and late-heading). This is based on the date when 50% a group of 60 spaced plants reach ear emergence (Grogan and Gilliland, 2010). As there is a genotype x environment interaction for heading date this date will change dependent on the prevailing environmental conditions and as such is not constant over years. As a solution, the national variety evaluation scheme has a set of delaminating varieties, that will change over years (Figure 2.4) and their heading date is utilized to categorize the maturity of perennial ryegrass varieties.
  Figure 2.4: Graph showing the flux in heading date of delaminating varieties between maturity classifications; from Grogan and Gilliland (2011).
However these divisions are artificial for the purposes of  practical management and the natural heading date of varieties forms a continuum (Gilliland, et al., 2002). The maximum heading date between varieties from separate maturity categories can be greater than from between varieties within a category. Nonetheless these divisions have been shown to be associated with differences in nutritive quality of varieties and animal production values (Gowen, et al., 2003; O'donovan and Delaby, 2005). Thus the heading date of a variety has an influence on the productivity and nutritive quality of a variety which influences optimal management practice (Frame, 1991). For silage production, heading date is viewed as an important target for harvesting for the optimal balance of productivity and nutritive quality.
2.4	Ryegrass breeding
There are many different breeding strategies employed worldwide, but these can be largely summarised into those reported by (Wilkins and Lovatt, 2010). These are mainstream breeding and population improvement;
i.	Mainstream breeding – For example, a breeding cycle begins with pair crosses of genetic material, the resultant seed is sow in individual spaced plots and evaluated over a number of years (usually 2 -3). During this period they are visually evaluated and some of this genetic material selected. The selected material is sown in clonal rows and allowed to cross-pollinate. The resultant progeny is sown in plots and the best genetic material from plot trials are selected to produce the new candidate variety.
ii.	Population improvement – In this approach, for example, a number of varieties are selected (e.g. 8 -20), based on traits on interest. The frequencies of these traits are increased through recurrent selection. All traits important for agronomic conditions must be evaluated to ensure progressive deterioration does not occur.
Early breeding effort was focused on improving dry matter yield and adaptive traits, such as disease resistance (Casler, 2000; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). However, improvements in management practices (e.g. fertilizer, pesticides) have seen large increases in productivity with little increase in demand for products. This increased productivity and the higher priority of additional traits has lead to herbage productivity becoming a decreased priority of breeding programs. The aims of ryegrass breeding programmes have been continually revised, reflecting the changing demands and attitudes of the market place.
Increasing the nutritive quality of ryegrasses has become a higher priority for breeding programmes, reflecting the increased awareness of potential animal productivity gains and environmental benefits from swards of increased nutritive quality (O'donovan, et al., 2010). The higher level of knowledge of environment impact of agriculture has lead to ‘Sustainable intensification’ becoming an increased priority of ryegrass breeding programmes; decreasing the environmental and economic costs of animal production while maintaining or increasing production (Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). Maximising the proportion of grazed grass in the diet is promoted as it minimises the carbon footprint of the production system and is desirable by some consumers as it is perceived as a welfare benefit to the animal (Barre, et al., 2006). Swards of increased nutritive quality can potentially address some of these priorities through;
i.	supporting more animals per unit land, through higher energy availability in the same land area 
ii.	decreasing the reliance on expensive concentrates, 
iii.	improving the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of available nitrogen in the rumen through an optimal balance of energy and nitrogen (Parsons, et al., 2011). 
However, breeding for nutritive quality traits, such as digestibility, can be viewed as acting against natural selection of the individual plant (Casler, 2000) but in favour of performance under agronomic conditions (Vogel and Pedersen, 2010). Thus, increased nutritive quality traits may be present in the natural gene pool, but will be expressed at levels below optimal for animal production under modern agricultural conditions. Breeding programs can thus select genetic material that induces increased nutritive quality and make these traits more prevalent, contributing to varieties of increased agronomic potential. 
The development of NIRS has allowed for the rapid and accurate assessment of nutritive quality traits and has facilitated the inclusion of nutritive quality traits in many breeding and evaluation programmes (Casler, 2000; Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). 
2.4.1	Genetic improvements though breeding
Breeding ryegrass varieties for increased herbage yield has historically been a high priority for breeding programmes (Casler and Santen, 2010). This has lead to an estimated average increase of 3.8 % dry matter yield per decade across Europe for perennial ryegrass varieties (Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003) with data from ‘Value for Cultivation and Use’ (VCU) trials in Belgium reporting a similar rate of increase for herbage yield of perennial ryegrass varieties at around 0.3 % per year between 1963 and 2007 (Chaves, et al., 2010). 
The rate of increase for nutritive quality has not been as clear, reflecting the recent increase in priority of nutritive quality traits. Wilkins and Lovatt (2010) estimated an increase of 10 g/kg for DMD and 51 g/kg DM for WSC concentration for intermediate diploids and 22 g/kg for DMD and 58 g/kg DM for WSC concentration for late heading tetraploids by comparing genetic material from 1980 to present day varieties. Pendergrast, et al. (2011) estimate that, based on data from the RL for England and Wales, there has been an average increase of 0.55 % D-value per year from 1982 to 2001, whereas Wilkins and Humphreys (2003) estimate the rate of improvement to be much lower at 1 % per decade. 
Persistence in the RL trials in Belgium has seen an increase of 0.56 % and 0.54 % per annum for L. perenne and L. multiflorum respectively over the past 40 years (Chaves, et al., 2009).
2.5	Herbage production
Herbage production is a measure of the herbage that is readily available to the grazing animal. Mechanical harvesting is a common method of assessing herbage production and it is often assessed on an area basis over a set time (Hopkins, 2000). In national variety evaluation schemes herbage production is commonly assessed by mowing replicated plots of monocultures at a set height and weighting the fresh herbage. These plot cutting schedules attempt to simulate grazing and/or conservation conditions and do so by modifying the cutting frequency and severity (Hopkins, 2000).
Herbage yield is assessed in almost every variety evaluation scheme emphasising the importance of herbage production in forage species (Casler and Santen, 2010). Herbage yield is an important trait for efficient and profitable ruminant-based production systems as many costs are incurred on a per unit land basis. Thus a variety of increased herbage yield potential can denote the following benefits (Conaghan, et al., 2008b);
i.	increased stocking rate (per unit land)
ii.	reduction on the requirement for expensive alternative feeds (e.g. concentrates)
iii.	reduction in dependence on land
Table 2.1: Total annual biomass production of perennial ryegrass swards
Total photosynthesis  	65.0 t DM/ha
Respiration	27.6 t DM/ha
Roots (including growth)	8.1 t DM/ha
Shoot decay	16.3 t DM/ha
Harvest DM yield	13.0 t DM/ha
Adapted from O'donovan, et al. (2011)

Perennial ryegrass swards have been reported to produce a potential total biomass of 65 t DM/ha (Table 2.1) however not all this production is available or utilizable for ruminant production systems, with the harvested herbage yield estimated at 13.0 t DM/ha. The range of annual yield of perennial ryegrass swards from Moorepark, Co. Cork during 1982 - 2009 was between 11.0 – 18.6 t DM/ha, averaging 14.0 t DM/ha (O'donovan, et al., 2010). In Northern Ireland the herbage yield is slightly lower due to less favourable climactic conditions with yields ranging from 8 – 17 t DM/ha (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011).
2.6	Forage quality 
Forage nutritive quality has several definitions; ‘the relative performance of animals when herbage is fed ad libitum to livestock’ (Buxton, et al., 1996; Mertens, 2007), ‘the expression of the potential of an animal response (meat or milk production, or other products) from forage from the utilization of its available nutrients’(Barnes and Marten, 1979), ‘the feeding value or the ability to utilise feed for production (e.g. milk, meat, wool)’ (Chaves, et al., 2006) or simply ‘animal performance’ (Coleman and Moore, 2003). Consistent throughout all these definitions of forage quality is that it is not solely a characteristic of the forage but that it is associated with animal factors. Forage quality is further complicated due to the rumination process that enables ruminants to digest forages, thus it can be seen as a three-way relationship between the ruminant, gut flora and the forage (Beever, et al., 2000). The relationships and interactions between factors are complex and not fully understood and an increased knowledge of these relationships could potentially improve ruminant production systems through the optimal balance of nutritive traits (e.g. WSC:CP ratio) and an increased rate of passage through the rumen, which may potentially lead to increased intake rates. Thus, forage nutritive quality includes;
i.	forage composition (e.g. ash, crude protein, WSC);
ii.	the ability to utilize the forage (e.g. DMD);
iii.	factors that influence the amount of forage ingested (e.g. palatability, sward structure, intake potential) (Beever, et al., 2000; Moore, et al., 2007).
Defining nutritive quality is further confounded by the fact that swards may have several functions (e.g. grazing, conservation or both). Swards are self regenerating and harvested several times within a year (Camlin, 1997), and a loss in productivity or nutritive quality at one harvest may be compensated for at a later harvest (Gilliland, 1997). Consequently, grass quality needs to be assessed throughout the growing season if a balanced overall judgement is to be made on a variety. 
Many factors can potentially influence the animal productivity from a grazed sward. Thus, for the purposes of a national variety evaluation scheme selecting a few independent qualitative traits that have a considerable influence on the animal performance potential of a variety would enable the user to make an informed decision as to which variety is best suited to their individual farming enterprise. The selection of nutritive quality traits of a variety must fit the following requirements;
i	Measurable (within a short time frame)
ii	Influence the potential animal performance characteristics of a variety
iii	Tangible differences must exist between varieties
2.6.1	 Herbage dry matter
In breeding programmes and evaluation schemes dry matter (DM) is usually determined to remove the confounding effects on moisture content on yield that is strongly associated with prevailing weather conditions (Knight, et al., 1996). The developmental stage, ploidy, and soil nutrient supply are all factors known to influence the internal moisture content (Butris and Phillips, 1987). The DM content of varieties is determined by a representative sub-sample of the fresh herbage taken and dried in a forced-draught oven enabling herbage yield per area to be calculated on a DM basis (Hopkins, 2000). Herbage productivity figures are often reported on a dry matter basis ((Grogan and Gilliland, 2011; Hopkins, 2000). It is well established that the voluntary intake of herbage is positively correlated with the herbage dry matter (Allen, 1996; John and Ulyatt, 1987). However Cabrera Estrada et al. (2003) found that the artificial application of external water (to represent rain or dew) on perennial ryegrass forage offered to cows ad libitum had no significant effect on the intake of cows. This surface water likely had a negligible retention time in the rumen and thus had a minimal influence on the rate of passage of the forage. In an additional study Cabrera Estrada et al. (2004) reported that the DM intake and eating rate of dairy cows was restricted by intracellular water but not external moisture content. The internal moisture is bound within the cell and remains part of the bolus, providing additional bulk in the rumen (Allen, 1996). Previous studies (Butris and Phillips, 1987; Phillips, et al., 1991) had contrasting results to Cabrera Estrada et al (2004) and reported external moisture had a negative effect on feeding behaviour and voluntary intake. However these studies (Butris and Phillips, 1987; Phillips, et al., 1991) submerged the forage in water for five minutes prior to being offered to cows which could have potentially affected the chemical composition of the herbage and likely an adverse effect of the palatability of the sample. Grass varieties with increased DM content for ensilage purpose could potentially have a greater reliability of fermentation, reduced losses through effluent and possible increased animal intakes (Knight, et al., 1996). 
2.6.2	Persistence
Persistency is an important trait to maintain a high proportion of perennial ryegrass content over the lifetime of the sward. A persistent sward will maintain DM yield potential and nutritive quality over a longer time period than a less persistent sward thus re-sowing will be required less frequent, which is an expensive process (Shalloo, et al., 2011; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003).
Significant differences in the rate of tiller survival have been shown between and within species (Camlin and Stewart, 1978). The benefit of having a sward with high yield potential and nutritive quality should be supplemented with good persistence, as invasive species have a lower yield potential and are also of lower nutritive quality, thus have a detrimental effect on the animal productivity potential of the sward (Wilkins, 1997).
 
Figure 2.5: Graph showing the relationship between the proportion of perennial ryegrass in the sward with herbage mass and tiller density from Creighton, et al. (2010)
2.6.3	Intake Potential
The ability of high genetic merit animals to ingest sufficient quantities of forage appears to be limiting the ability to sustain high levels of production and the ad libitum intake potential accounts for most of the variation in ruminant productivity (Mertens, 2007). It is, however, a difficult and costly trait to assess (Buxton, et al., 1996). A limiting constraint to the voluntary intake of forages is the relatively large volume to weight ratio. Van Soest (1994) termed this the ‘hotel concept’. The volume of the forage (hotel building) is greater than what would be expected from the masticated tissue (demolished rubble). In the duodenum of cows, particles of greater than 1.2 mm diameter are rarely found and this had lead to a theory that the physical breakdown of forages could be a limiting factor and restrict the rate of  passage through the rumen (Hopkins, 2000). 
At pasture the availability of forage for grazing can be a limiting factor and thus proper management should ensure the availability of forage (Figure 2.6).  
Figure 2.6: Factors effecting the intake potential of ruminants adapted from Dillon (2006)
There is a limit to which a grazing animal can compensate for a reduced bite mass by increasing biting rate or grazing time. At a DM content of 12-25% the intake potential has been shown to be positively correlated with DM content (John and Ulyatt, 1987).
Barre, et al. (2006) found differences in the short term intake potential (kg-1 DM cow-1 h-1) which were related to the morphological features of the sward. Blade leaf length was shown to be positively correlated with short term intake rate (R2 = 0.70). In their study slight differences were found in the nutritive quality of the four varieties however, these had no significant effect on the short term intake rate of Holstein dairy cows. The nutritive quality of forage plays less of a role in the short term intake as nutritional factors play a greater role in the retention time of rumination and are likely to have a greater influence on the long term intake potential of varieties (Baumont, et al., 2000).

2.6.4	Analytical measurements of forage quality
Nutritive quality traits are assessed through analytical means that provide a measure of the chemical composition factors associated with animal production ((Moore, et al., 2007); Table 2.2).
2.6.4.1	Digestibility 
Digestibility is often cited as the single best indicator of the nutritive quality over a wide range of forage species and managements (Casler, 2000; Wheeler and Corbett, 1989; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003) and is viewed as the most important trait for improving the nutritive quality of the sward (Smith, et al., 1997). The greatest loss in terms of DM is through faeces (Coleman and Moore, 2003) and digestibility is effectively the difference in the amount of forage consumed and the amount voided in the faeces (Coleman and Moore, 2003). An increase in digestibility can potentially improve animal performance through making more energy available from the sward to the ruminant and also through improvements in intake potential (Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003).
For particles to pass through the rumen they must first be broken down (Waghorn, et al., 1989), so digestibility influences the retention rates and rate of passage through the rumen. The retention of particles in the rumen is a major limitation to the voluntary intake of animals (Wilson and Kennedy, 1996), thus an increased digestibility of forage can lead to an increased animal performance by increased animal intake, energy availability and lower retention times in the rumen. (Dillon, 2006) reported an increase in dry matter intake and milk production as the digestibility of the sward increases.
(Casler and Vogel, 1999) reported a 1% increase in DMD led to an average increase of 3.2% live weight gain in beef cattle, emphasising the importance of DMD as small increases can have large animal production benefits.
Digestibility estimates were originally assessed through in vivo experiments involving a measurement of the forage consumed and faeces excreted. This methodology is costly and time-consuming and can last up to 7 days. In vitro DMD is based on a number of techniques; including a two-stage digestion technique, first with 48 hour anaerobic incubation with rumen liquor then a further 48 hour anaerobic incubation with acid pepsin (Tilley and Terry, 1963) that are highly correlated with in vivo measurements.

Figure 2.7: Three commonly used calculations used to estimate digestibility
There are a number of different commonly used calculations to assess in vitro digestibility (Figure 2.7). Organic matter digestibility (OMD) can potentially provide better estimate of the nutritive value of forage compared to DMD as it eliminates any potential contamination by soil (Hopkins, 2000). 
In the early work for digestibility it was unclear how much of the variation between perennial ryegrass varieties was due to the relative development stage of varieties and how much was an intrinsic property of the variety. Wilkins (1997) reported significant differences between three varieties of similar heading dates over several cutting regimes and two harvest years concluded that variation exists for digestibility between perennial ryegrass varieties and this could be implemented into breeding programmes. Casler (2000) suggests that due to the wealth of genetic variation present in the digestibility in forage crops, little selection (natural or unconscious) has occurred leading to the conclusion that genetic improvements in digestibility could be more easily obtained than forage yield.
2.6.4.2	Metabolizable Energy
Digestibility of the forages provides an estimate of the nutrients available to the ruminant, however not all the digested forage is available for production. In ruminants a large proportion of energy is lost through methane production, through anaerobic fermentation in the rumen and through urine. 
2.6.4.3	Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates provide an excellent source of readily available energy from the forage to the ruminant. For the purposes of nutritive quality, carbohydrates can be sub-divided into soluble and non-soluble carbohydrates providing an indication of their ease of use by the ruminant (Hatfield et al., 2004). Water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) are those which are not bound to any cellular structure and are freely available for microbial activity in the rumen. (Humphreys, 1989a; Humphreys, 1989b) reported WSC concentration to be a consistent and heritable trait amongst perennial ryegrass varieties that has potential benefits for animal productivity and efficiency. Smith, et al. (1997) reported that increased WSC concentration was the second highest priority of grass breeders for increasing the nutritive quality of forages for dairy production systems.
It has been purposed that an increased WSC concentration can potentially increase the palatability of a variety leading to higher intake rates greater ruminant productivity values (Humphreys, 1989c). Moorby, et al. (2006) reported that for dairy cattle in an early lactation grazing on swards with increased WSC concentration had increased grass intake rates, that lead to increased milk production and a proportional decrease in urinary N excretion. Although the mechanism by which swards with increased WSC concentration induce higher intake rates is unknown, one possible explanation is olfactory cues.
Increasing levels of WSC concentration provides a means of optimizing the protein and energy ratio available to gut flora (Humphreys, 1989c). This can potentially lead to an increased nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the forage by the gut flora (Parsons, et al., 2011). Increased WSC concentration can potentially confer an environmental benefit through improved balance of nitrogen to a rapidly fermentable carbon source (i.e. WSC) for gut micro-organisms; this increases the efficiency of protein conversion from forage to microbial, resulting in higher N available for milk production and less lost through excretion (Miller, et al., 2001). However the level at which an increase in WSC concentration produces a biological response is unclear, as additional studies (Moorby, et al., 2006; Taweel, et al., 2005) are inconclusive in their milk quality response to WSC concentration. Owens, et al. (2008) found that adding sucrose (artificially increasing WSC content) to grass silage had little effect on NUE or efficiency of microbial protein synthesis.
The WSC concentration plays a key role in many survival mechanisms and adaptations of perennial ryegrass. Increased WSC concentration offers increased tiller survival rates, sward persistency and initial re-growth following defoliation (Fulkerson and Donaghy, 2001). These factors are important for breeding a persistent and high-quality grass for animal production (Humphreys, 1989a). Significant genetic differences exist between varieties and they are consistent across the growing season however mid-season cuts showed some maturity effects in the form of a change of ranking (Humphreys, 1989b). Differences also exist throughout the growing season showing an effect of environment and maturity on WSC concenration (Humphreys, 1989b). Beerepoot and Agnew (1997) suggested that increasing the WSC concentration in a variety could potentially lead to a lower pH in the gut rumen. This lower pH would slow the bacterial activity in the rumen and lead to higher retention rates in the rumen and this could potentially slow intake and production rates. 
The mechanism by which a high WSC genotype is conferred is not fully understood. Smith, et al. (2002) proposed four potential mechanisms;
i.	Reduced growth rate
ii.	Improved efficiency of respiration and/or photosynthesis
iii.	Modified carbon partitioning between structural and non-structural components
iv.	Modified carbon partitioning between roots and shoot
Plant tissues or organs can be defined as ‘source’ (producing carbohydrates) or ‘sinks’ (utilization of carbohydrates) for carbohydrate. WSC concentration within a plant is a balance of the assimilation of carbon by photosynthesis, the net use by plant growth and respiration (Humphreys, 1989a). These relationships are dynamic and change in response to environmental and physiological factors.
The synthesis of WSC only occurs in the presence of sunlight and is stored for use during darker hours. This forms a diurnal pattern of WSC concentration in the plant that has long been reported (Lechtenberg, et al., 1971). This diurnal pattern of WSC concentration was found to closely associate with the DM intake of sheep (Orr, et al., 2005). When comparing AM vs. PM grazing behaviour of dairy cattle, Orr, et al. (2001a) found that predominantly perennial ryegrass swards contained a higher WSC concentration in the evening (175 vs. 204 g/kg DM, s.e.d. 6.67) and concentrating grazing behaviour in the evening could be a adaptation to maximise foraging efficiency. 
2.6.4.4	Crude Protein
Crude protein (CP) is an estimate of the amount of protein within the grass. It is an accepted assumption that 16 % protein content is nitrogen, thus by multiplying the nitrogen content by 6.25 an estimate of protein content (crude) is derived.
A CP concentration 8 % DM is thought to be limiting to ruminant function (Coleman and Moore, 2003). The CP concentrarion of ryegrass generally exceed this threshold throughout the growing season (O'donovan, et al., 2010). The lowest CP concentration occurs when grown in grass-legume mixture during reproductive growth in late spring and early summer (Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). If CP concentration is limiting it has received little attention from breeding programmes as increased application of N fertilizer has been shown as an effective strategy to increase CP concentration in swards (Binnie, et al., 2001). However, with the increased cost of N fertilizer and environmental concerns; increasing the NUE of swards has become an increased priority to the optimal use of N. At present the efficiency of N at farm level is low, with Castillo, et al. (2001) estimating efficiency of N use at between 15 – 26% on intensive dairy farms with a theoretical maximum at c.45% (Van Vuuren, et al., 1986). As CP concentration is not normally limiting to animal production systems (Coleman and Moore, 2003), this trait is a low priority for reporting the nutritive quality on national variety evaluation schemes for ryegrass. (Gilliland, et al., 2002; O'donovan, et al., 2011).
2.6.4.5	Ensilabilityy
Buffering capacity is the ability of a grass to maintain a pH while an acid or alkali is added. It is an important trait, particularly in silage production in which the pH is one of the most crucial factors determining the successful ensiling of grass herbage. The growing season in Ireland is highly seasonal, with a large disparity in herbage yield and quality between highest and lowest month. Conservation of ryegrass (e.g. ensiling) provides the opportunity to fill seasonal gaps in availability (O'kiely and Kaiser, 2005). However little attention is paid to the ensilage properties of grass varieties in national variety evaluation schemes (Conaghan, et al., 2008c). Buffering capacity provides an assessment of the quantity of fermentation acids required to obtain adequate anaerobic preservation and supplemented with additional information on the nutritive content of the variety (e.g. WSC) can provide a indication of the ensilability (Buxton and O'kiely, 2003).
2.6.5	Relationships between nutritive traits
There is a perception of a negative relationship between herbage yield and nutritive quality of the sward (Aldrich and Dend, 1963). This perceived relationship comes from the increase in herbage productivity that occurs as the sward advances in maturity with a corresponding decrease in the nutritive quality (Aldrich and Dend, 1963; Chaves, et al., 2006; Humphreys and O'kiely, 2006). For example, Gilliland (1995) reported that delaying first cut silage lead to an improvement in herbage yield of perennial ryegrass swards but had a associated negative effect on the digestibility of those swards. Gilliland (1997) suggested this response was associated with the physiological stage of tillers at defoliation as compensatory re-growth occurred in which the ranking of the varieties at the second cut silage for digestibility and herbage yield was reversed compared to the first cut silage. This highlights some of the difficulties in assessing the nutritive quality of ryegrasses as there is a response to the management of the sward and also a necessity to balance priorities between nutritive quality traits.
Humphreys (Humphreys, 1989c) reported a positive correlation between digestibility and WSC concentration in perennial ryegrass swards during the later stages of the growing season. Humphreys (1989c) suggests that differences in reproductive stem development rate between varieties in the early part of the growing season masked any relationship between digestibility and WSC concentration. Humphreys (1989c) also noted a lack of relationship between herbage yield and WSC concentration and thus concluded that WSC concentration could be a useful trait for perennial ryegrass breeding. 
Thus the complex relationships and interactions between nutritive quality traits, sward management and environmental responses confound the interpretation of results (Beever, et al., 2000).
2.7	Sward Composition 
In Ireland the majority of grass seed is sold and sown as variety mixtures with several different seed components (Gilliland, et al., 2007). There are a number of proposed advantages for the sowing of seed in mixtures; a synergistic effect where the herbage yield of a mixture of varieties is greater than the sum of the parts (Elgersma, et al., 1998; Simmonds, 1962) however additional research has shown that the herbage yield of mixtures is not always greater than the greatest individual component (Culleton, et al., 1986). There is a perception that seed mixtures are multi-purpose and that several components can provide an adaptability that helps maintain productivity over a range of environmental and management conditions (Ingram, 1997). Gilliland, et al. (2010) suggested a substantial reason for the use of seed mixtures is driven by commercial priorities rather than purely agronomic value, as they provide the seed merchant with better control over stock and balance supply for high demanded varieties. 
In natural grassland eco-systems studies have shown that increased levels of biodiversity of can improve its productivity (Mouquet, et al., 2002). A number of interactions can occur leading to increased productivity including; niche complementarily and positive inter-specific interactions (Nyfeler, et al., 2009). However in high input grassland systems, such as many farming practices with intensive fertilizer input commonly practised throughout Ireland, the relationship between biodiversity and agronomic performance is unclear with the majority of herbage yield accounted for by a small number of species (e.g. L. perenne, T. repens). Transgressive over-yielding has been reported in grass-legume swards where the yield of the mixture is at least as high as the highest performing individual component (Connolly, et al., 2009; Nyfeler, et al., 2009).
Gilliland, et al. (2010) reported that in perennial ryegrass mixtures the yield of the mixture was not significantly greater than that predicted by the sum of the individual varieties based on performance in monoculture plots. However, Gilliland, et al. (2010) reported that the wider the range in heading date among the individual varieties of the mixtures there was a tendency for increased yield stability over years but with a declining yield advantage for the mixture compared to its individual varieties grown as monocultures. 
2.8	Morphological features
The structure and morphology of the sward also plays a significant role in the ability of an animal to ingest forage. Flores-Lesama, et al. (2006) assessed the milk production value of four perennial ryegrass varieties on a fixed herbage allowance (18 kg DM/day) and found that the nutritive quality of each of the varieties was not significantly different. However a significant difference was reported in milk production of 0.4 kg cow/day between two of the perennial ryegrass varieties. The variety that induced this increased milk production had a higher bulk density and green leaf mass in the upper layers of the sward than that with the lower production value.
A number of sward structure and morphological traits have been reported as having an influence on the animal intake and productivity, including;
i.	botanical composition (Jacobs, et al., 1999)
ii.	leaf : stem ratio (Penning, et al., 1994)
iii.	sward surface height (Mcgilloway, et al., 1997) 
iv.	herbage bulk density  (Flores-Lesama, et al., 2006; Mcgilloway, et al., 1999; Soder, et al., 2009b)
v.	extended tiller height and leaf length (Soder, et al., 2009a)
vi.	stem and pseudostem proportion (Griffiths, et al., 2003)
vii.	leaf orientation and tensile strength (Mtengeti, et al., 1995). 
Much of the research on the influence of sward structure and morphological traits has on animal productivity has been assessing the influence that management practises have on altering these traits. However there is potential for genetic differences to affect sward structure and if targeted by breeders this could result in a higher intake potential. (Smit, et al., 2005).
Barrett, et al. (2003) assessed the relationship of sward characteristics and bite dimensions from artificial swards and concluded that these were applicable to field swards however the lack of precision in assessing short-term intake and for sward-based measurements is prohibitive for these traits to be included in the evaluation of grass varieties. 
2.9	Evaluation of ryegrass varieties
Under the EU directive S.I. No. 525/2002, member states are required to set up official growing trials of agricultural varieties that are marketable under local climatic and soil conditions. These trials are termed ‘Value for Cultivation and Use’ (VCU) and prior to any variety being recommended for use in that constituency it must have a clear agronomic improvement from the varieties already recommended for use (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). 
In Ireland the evaluation of grass varieties is carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine (DAFM) and the culmination of the work is an annual publication of grass and clover varieties recommended for use in Ireland (Department of Agriculture, 2011), known as the recommended list (RL). This publication lists the relative performance (i.e. ranking) of ryegrass varieties within species in agronomic traits of interest. The traits of interest are commonly seasonal and annual herbage yield, persistence and to a lesser extent nutritive quality. The publication of the RL provides a vital role to the ruminant-based grassland production systems through the identification and promoting the use of novel varieties that have the potential to increase animal productivity (Grogan and Gilliland, 2010). 
The aim of the variety evaluation schemes is to assess the genetic potential of a variety for a particular agronomic trait of interest (e.g. herbage yield). However the agronomic performance of a variety for any particular trait is dictated by a number of factors and interactions and these can confound the task of determining the true genetic potential of a variety. This can be represented by:
Agronomic performance of trait (e.g. yield) = G + E + M + GxE + GxM + GxExM
Where;
G = Genotype
E = Environment
M = Management
Thus evaluation occurs at several sites throughout Ireland to reflect the range in environmental conditions experienced in Ireland and also under two management regimes. The management regimes are a combined simulated grazing & conservation management and also a simulated grazing management, which reflects the majority of management practises occurring on Irish grassland production systems.
2.9.1	Genotype x Environment Interactions
The agronomic performance of a variety (genotype) can differ dependent on the environment in which it grows (e.g. climatic conditions, soil conditions, biotic conditions). For the purposes of evaluation schemes the relative performance of varieties (i.e. ranking) is more important than the absolute figures as these are only specific to the individual test site and conditions. The goal of any evaluation scheme is to assess the phenotypic merit of a variety; however this is confounded by genotype x environment (G x E) interactions. Crossover interactions (i.e. rank changes) between varieties are common in variety evaluation schemes with the implication that a variety that is superior in one environment may not maintain this superiority in another (Conaghan, et al., 2008a). These interactions have several important implications; if G x E interaction(s) exists this necessitates the evaluation of the variety in the desired environment. If crossover interactions exist then the results of one environment cannot be easily extrapolated to another environment (Conaghan, et al., 2008a).
In evaluation schemes for switchgrasses a significant G x E interaction was reported for herbage yield whereby the test site of evaluation influenced the ranking of varieties (Casler and Boe, 2003; Hopkins, et al., 1995b).The performance of a variety had a tendency to be related to the origin of variety, whereby varieties were more likely to be high ranking at test locations that were geographically closer to their breeding origin. Hopkins, et al. (1995b) suggests that this is likely to be because varieties have adaptations suited to local climatic and soil conditions and thus are more likely to thrive in those conditions. 
(Conaghan, et al., 2008a) assessed the level of G x E interactions of herbage yield across six sites and over five consecutive sowings. The largest component of G x E variation was in the genotype x location x year which emphasises the need for an evaluation system to trial varieties over a number of years and locations. The level of variation for location and years was similar and this lead the authors to conclude that for the purposes of evaluating varieties across a number of environments, location and years are interchangeable. 
2.9.2	Genotype x Management interaction
National variety evaluation schemes commonly use mechanical harvested plots to provide an indication of the forage that would likely be grazed by the animal (Hopkins, 2000). However, mechanically harvested plots do not accurately replicate the conditions of grazed swards; as they are not subjected to treading or fouling and the cutting mechanism does not reflect the same technique of biting by animals (Hopkins, 2000). Another factor is the recycling of nitrogen through urine. (Grogan and Gilliland, 2010) estimate as much as 70% of N from nitrogenous waste products is recycled in animal-based systems that can be re-utilised by the sward. As this nutritent recycling does not occur on plots mechanically harvested to simulate grazing, to account for this the nitrogen application on simulated grazing plots is higher than application rates used on farm.
(Wims, et al., 2010) carried out a study comparing animal grazing to the simulated grazing plots of 15 perennial ryegrass varieties. The yield of simulated grazing plots was on average 18 % higher than their grazed pairs; however no significant genotype x management interaction occurred. So they concluded that the simulated grazing trials may not provide the same data in absolute terms of variety yield under animal grazing but the relative performance (i.e. ranking) is the same and thus can provide a reliable representation of animal performance.
Mcevoy, et al. (2010) compared two cutting regimes; a combined conservation and simulated grazing with a 2-cut silage management and reported a significant genotype x management (G x M) interaction with a change in the rank order of varieties for herbage yield. Thus the cutting regime can have a significant effect on the relative performance of varieties and is an important consideration for the cutting regime used in national variety evaluation schemes. 
2.9.3	Weaknesses 
Assessing varieties primarily based on herbage yield provides only a partial indicator of the true animal performance potential of a variety (Munro, et al., 1992). The minimal information on the nutritive quality and morphological traits has often been cited as one weakness of the RL trials (Conaghan, et al., 2008c; Gilliland, et al., 2002; Hazard, et al., 1998; Orr, et al., 1988; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). The inclusion of nutritive quality and morphological traits would provide a more reliable indication of the animal performance potential of the sward (see below). Nutritive quality traits are increasingly reported on national variety evaluation schemes with digestible figures often cited (Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). In vitro DMD and WSC concentration were first included into the Irish variety evaluation scheme in 2007 (Department of Agriculture, 2011; Grogan and Gilliland, 2010).
It is widely acknowledged that animal trials would provide a more accurate and reliable indication of the animal performance potential of a ryegrass variety (Barre, et al., 2006; Beerepoot and Agnew, 1997; Casler and Vogel, 1999; Hopkins, 2000; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003). A large degree of replication is required to account for the variation within and between animals, which makes animal trials prohibitive in terms of time and money for the purposes of a national variety evaluation scheme (Barre, et al., 2006; Orr, et al., 2001b). As such, animal trials have been carried out on smaller scales assessing a small number of varieties. These small scale trails enable a reliable estimate of the influence nutritive quality traits have on animal productivity and thus an inference can be made on the animal productivity potential on varieties from evaluation schemes based on nutritive quality. 
Persistence of mechanically harvested plots is also assessed to provide an indication of the longevity of the sward. However these are not true persistence measurements but ground cover scores each plot after a number of years under mechanical harvesting. Mechanical harvesting of plots, as previously stated, does not reflect grazing dynamics and does not provide a reliable indication of the persistence of a variety under grazing conditions. 
The growing year in Ireland is highly seasonal (O'kiely and Kaiser, 2005) and the need for a continual supply of feed throughout the year means that grass conservation (e.g. ensiling) is commonly practiced, occurring on 0.87 of all Irish Farms (Connolly, et al., 2002). However on the national variety evaluation scheme for Ireland ensilability is given little consideration (Conaghan, et al., 2008c). Providing information on buffering capacity, which indicates the amount of fermentation acids and thus of fermentable substrate required, and WSC concentration, the primary source of fermentable substrate during ensilage, could combine to provide an ensilabiltiy index which would enable the selection of varieties particularly suited for ensilage purposes, maximising the efficiency of the ensilage process (Buxton and O'kiely, 2003).
Ryegrass varieties are evaluated as monocultures on national variety evaluation schemes (Grogan and Gilliland, 2010), however this does not reflect the practise on farming enterprises, where the majority of seed is sown as mixtures of several varieties and species (Gilliland, et al., 2010; Gilliland, et al., 2007). The productivity and nutritive quality of mixed swards is not simply the average of their component monocultures due to potential competitive and synergistic effects (Nyfeler, et al., 2009). Sward dynamics and interactions between varieties are poorly understood and are considered a gap in the knowledge (Gilliland, et al., 2010). For evaluation schemes the testing of mixtures would be unfeasible due to the large number of permutations of mixtures of varieties. 
2.10	Performance Index
The value of forage is ultimately defined through animal production values (Camlin, 1997) rather than forage productivity and nutritive quality traits, which act as a indication for the potential animal performance over a range of nutritive quality traits, management practise, tissue development stage and ruminant species and physiological state (e.g. sex, body weight, period of lactation). The concept of a performance index has important practical implications as it enables the amalgamation of a number of nutritive quality and productivity traits to provide a holistic appraisal of the animal production potential of a grass variety.

The Hay Marketing Task Force of American Forage and Grassland Council developed ‘relative forage quality’ as a nutritive quality index to define the nutritive quality of hay into a single figure (Rohweder, et al., 1978). Since its induction there has been a shift in the economic value of hay to be considered on a quality basis; thus providing an economic value to the nutritive quality of forage.
An economic index for the assessment of the relative value of perennial ryegrass varieties was developed by (Mcevoy, et al. (2011). An economic value (euros per hectare per annum) is assigned to traits that are of benefit to animal production values for Irish grass-based ruminant production systems. The index assesses the performance of perennial ryegrass varieties to a base scenario. The economic value of herbage yield changes throughout the growing season (Table 2.3), which reflects the supply (grass growth) and demand (herd requirements) of the Irish ruminant based production systems. Thus, in ‘Spring’ herbage yield is low relative to demand in comparison to ‘Mid-Season’; hence herbage yield in ‘Spring’ has a higher economic value. Thus, varieties with a greater proportion of their herbage yield in ‘Spring’ and ‘Autumn’ will benefit from this selection index and this reflects animal production values and the objectives of forage breeders (Casler and Santen, 2010). 
2.11	 Reseeding
The reseeding of grass swards has agronomic benefits through the sowing of novel varieties with increased herbage yield and nutritive quality. Over time the proportion of perennial ryegrass in the sward tends to decrease as natural grassland species invade (Hopkins, et al., 1988) and these natural species tend to have a lower yield potential and are of lower quality (Wilkins, 1997).Thus reseeding ensures a higher proportion of desired species in the swards leading to improvements in animal production from these swards. However the potential animal production benefits must be weighted up against the economic cost of re-sowing the sward and the transition period in which the sward cannot be grazed. Shalloo, et al. (2011) modelled the economic cost of re-sowing and reported that it only conveyed an economic advantage if there was a corresponding increase in the utilization of the sward (through increased stocking rate) to match the increased productivity of the sward.
2.12	Conclusion
A major benefit of selecting a variety of increased productivity and nutritive quality is these traits are genetic and require a one off investment (purchasing seed) without an increase in production costs for a continual investment over the longevity of the sward (Camlin, 1997) 
A grass variety of increased nutritive quality has been shown to have not only animal production benefits but a positive benefit to the environment. The use of varieties of increased WSC concentration have the potential to increase the NUE in the rumen and decrease nitrogenous losses through urine (Miller, et al., 2001; Moorby, et al., 2006).
The improvement of forage breeding has traditionally focused on herbage yield and adaptive characteristics (Casler, 1990), however increased focus is now placed on forage nutritive quality (O'donovan, et al., 2011). There is still a potential to increase herbage yield of perennial ryegrass varieties through grass breeding programs however a holistic view of the sward will allow for increased animal production and efficiency (O'donovan, et al., 2010).
2.13	Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS)
The potential of NIRS as a means of rapidly measuring nutritive quality traits and intake potential was first described by Norris et al. (1976). Even with limited computational power and the field in its infancy Norris, et al. (1976) were able to develop calibration models that successfully measured CP (R = 0.99), NDF (R = 0.98), ADF (R = 0.96), in vitro DMD (R = 0.95), n vivo DMD (R = 0.88) and DM intake (R = 0.85). Since this landmark paper, NIRS has been cited as one of the major driving forces in the improvement of nutritional quality in forages (Casler, 2000; Pollock, et al., 2005; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003) becoming a routine method of estimating nutritive quality traits in grass breeding and evaluation programmes (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Givens, et al., 1997).
2.13.1	Theory
The near infrared region of light occurs between 1100-2500 nm (Cen and He, 2007; Givens, et al., 1997). Infrared radiation is absorbed by all biological compounds but mainly the carbon-hydrogen [C-H], nitrogen-hydrogen [N-H] and oxygen-hydrogen [O-H] bonds (Deaville and Flinn, 2000; Foley, et al., 1998; Stuth, et al., 2003). These three bonds exist in the majority of the organic compounds of plant tissue and the interaction between the absorbed radiation and these bonds can provide information on the chemical composition of the sample (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b; Stuth, et al., 2003). An absorbance band is produced in the spectrum when NIR radiation is generated at the same wavelength of the natural frequency of the molecular bond in a sample (John, et al., 2007). Absorbance bands are defined by three factors (John, et al., 2007); 
•	Location
•	Height
•	Width

Wavelength	Bond	
1940 nm	Water (O-H)x2	Combination
1450 nm	Water (O-H)x2	First overtone
2310 nm	Lipids (C-H)	
1725 nm	Lipids (C-H)	
1400 nm 	Lipids (C-H)	
1210 nm	Lipids (C-H)	
2100 nm	Carbohydrates (O-H)	
1600 nm	Carbohydrates (O-H)	
2180 nm	Nitrogen (N-H)	
2055 nm	Nitrogen (N-H)	
Figure 2.8: Near infrared spectrum displaying the absorbance wavelengths of major functional groups adapted from Deaville and Flinn (2000)

This is complicated by the fact that each absorbance band has a series of overtone bands, that are of decreased intensity (Shenk, et al., 2007) and in addition absorbance bands can overlap. Thus the absorbance spectrum of a sample is the summation of the individual molecular bonds (Deaville and Flinn, 2000). An example of the prominent absorbance bands is displayed in Figure 2.8. The nitrogen bands occur due to the N-H bonds present in the amide structure of proteins, however these can be masked by the O-H band at 2100 nm (Deaville and Flinn, 2000). The application of NIRS is to extract meaningful information on the nutritive quality from the spectra and this can be achieved through the use of chemometrics, as described later in this chapter. 

2.13.2	Advantages
NIRS has a number of advantages over traditional laboratory methods that has seen it become a routine method of evaluating the nutritive quality of forages (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010). The rapid turnaround time of sample analysis is often cited as a key advantage of NIRS (Givens, et al., 1997; Stuth, et al., 2003) and dependent on the make and model of the instrument can take as little as one minute per sample (Cen and He, 2007). NIRS will also allow multiple nutritive quality traits to be analysed simultaneously from a small amount of sample c. 0.2 g, further augmenting the speed of this approach (Foley, et al., 1998). It is also non-destructive, with the sample available for further analysis if required (Cen and He, 2007). This is in contrast to in vitro techniques such as the digestibility technique of Tilley and Terry (1963) which can require up to a week to process a single sample and no sample remains at the end of analysis.
Another often cited benefit is the low-cost of analysis after initial capital costs.  Foley, et al. (1998) estimated that using NIRS can confer up to an 80 % cost saving compared to reference laboratory methods. In addition, NIRS reduces the use of the organic chemicals and reagents associated with the reference laboratory methods, to a limited number of validation/outlier samples. As these are potentially damaging to the environment, it has lead to NIRS being termed a relatively ‘Green and Clean’ technology (Armenta, et al., 2008).
Once calibration models have been developed and validated, the routine analysis of samples requires minimal expertise (Givens, et al., 1997; Stuth, et al., 2003). Minimal preparation of samples is another cited benefit (Givens, et al., 1997) however calibration models are often developed using dried and milled samples to minimize the confounding effects of moisture and particle size on calibration models (Givens, et al., 1997). This is not a prerequisite as Park, et al. (1997) was able to develop calibration models using fresh ‘wet’ grass silage to a slightly lower degree of accuracy than similar dried and milled samples. The increasing computational power and advancements in technology has enabled the development of smaller portable NIRS instrumentation allowing real-time in field analysis of samples that were previously restricted to the laboratory. Calibration models for the in-field analysis of forages have successfully been developed for these instruments (Biewer, et al., 2009). However there are additional factors to consider when using in-field calibration models, such as the prevailing weather conditions, (e.g. cloud cover and rainfall) which have been shown to adversely affect the accuracy of calibration models using these instruments (Perbandt, et al., 2010).
2.13.3	Weaknesses
The initial capital costs of instrumentation are relatively expensive and may require the processing of a large number of samples to justify this investment. There is a requirement to develop and maintain calibration models for each nutritive quality trait of interest which can be a lengthy and complex process requiring a high degree of expertise (Givens, et al., 1997; Stuth, et al., 2003). To maintain a calibration model there is an ongoing requirement for testing, using reference laboratory methods, of outliers and a limited number of validation samples. 
Calibration models are specific to the variation within them, thus they can only be applied to a specific data-set that is likely to contain similar variation. Stuth, et al. (2003) suggested that the variation encompassed in the calibration set should be in terms of;
•	Temporal (e.g. time or seasonal period)
•	Spatial (e.g. geographical location)
•	Biological (e.g. tissue, variety, species,)
The analysis of forages is continually expanding in both a spatial and temporal context (Cen and He, 2007) thus samples in the future may be outside the variation encompassed within the original calibration set and would need to be analysed by reference laboratory methods. 
The accuracy of calibration models decline rapidly as the concentration of the variable of interest declines below 1 % (Cen and He, 2007). However, for the nutritive analysis of forages many of the traits of interest are orders of magnitude above this threshold (Givens, et al., 1997; Roberts, et al., 2003).

A potential issue with relating spectrum to chemical composition data is that reference methods are not related to the molecular vibration of the spectrum and/or not defined by these molecular vibrations (John, et al., 2007). For example, nitrogen has no direct vibration response in the near infrared region therefore cannot be directly measured by NIRS. However the most accurate calibration models are for assessing CP concentration (N x 6.25) (Jafari, et al., 2003; Roberts, et al., 2003), thus these depend on a strong relationship between the N-H bond and the total N in a sample (John, et al., 2007; Roberts, et al., 2003).
2.13.4	Sample Preparation 
Although the minimal sample preparation required prior to NIRS analysis is a benefit (Givens, et al., 1997), sample preparation is one of the main causes of error in the designing and implementation of calibrations (Williams 2007). Williams (2007) cites 34 factors associated with sampling that can contribute to error in the overall calibration model(s) (Table 2.4).
As previously stated NIRS is a secondary method that makes a prediction of a constituent based on the spectral properties of that particular sample. These spectral properties are dependent on the chemical composition and structure of the presented sample (Deaville and Flinn, 2000). The sample processing prior to NIRS analysis can alter the sample’s chemical composition and structure (Alomar, et al., 2003). Thus when designing a protocol for analysis a method should be designed to minimize effects on the chemical composition and structure and ensure that the spectrum and thus the predictions are accurately made (Alomar, et al., 2003)
2.13.5	Moisture
Removal of residual moisture from forages is common practice in the assessment of nutritive quality. Moisture content is highly dictated by prevailing weather conditions which can be extremely variable (Roche, et al., 2009), thus analysing material on a DM basis minimises this variation and standardises the samples. Low moisture content also facilities the storages of samples as those with higher moisture content are prone to degradation.
Moisture content provides an additional dilemma for the development and application of NIRS predictive calibration models. Moisture (e.g. water) contains a high proportion of O-H bonds which generate large absorbance bands in the NIR spectrum and these large bands have the potential to obscure and conceal other absorbance bands. 
The drying of samples to remove moisture content has been shown to improve the performance of calibration in terms of lower standard error of calibrations and higher coefficients of determination than those developed without a drying procedure (Reeves 2000). However, this is confounded by the number of drying methods (oven dried, freeze dried, microwave) over a number of temperatures and durations (Alomar, et al., 2003; Pelletier, et al., 2010).
Lovett, et al. (2005) found that developing calibration models for assessing the nutritive quality of maize (Zea mays L.) using oven dried samples at 60oC had a higher accuracy than 100oC for 19 out of 26 quality traits. The authors also found that the removal of residual moisture (re-drying for 4 hours at original temperature), which ranged from 29 – 103 g/kg, after the milling procedure had a minimal effect of accuracy of calibration models and thus did not justify this additional expense and time.
Alomar et al. (2003) carried out a comparison of oven and freeze drying methods on the chemical composition and spectral properties of forage samples. A comparison of the spectra on freeze dried and oven dried samples using principle component analysis showed a clear separation of samples via mahalanobis distance, inferring that the processing of samples had a profound effect on their spectra. This difference was also reported in soluble protein, NDF and insoluble nitrogen in the NDF when using these different drying methods. No significant differences existed for dry matter, CP, crude fibre, ADF or in vitro OMD when using the different drying methods. They found also no significant effect of freeze-drying method when comparing liquid nitrogen freezing to conventional freezing. Alomar, et al. (2003) thus recommended that the sample preparation should be consistent to minimize the error associated with the spectrum and increase predication accuracy. 
Feuerstein and Paul (2007) assessed the use on NIRS instrumentation on-board forage harvesters for the real-time nutritive quality analysis of forages. One of the major limiting factors to the accuracy of these calibration models is because of the high presence of moisture. At present this is restricting the application of on field-based and on-board harvester analysis to dry conditions.
2.13.6	Milling (Particle size)
Early research on NIRS has shown that particle size can have a considerable impact on the near infrared spectrum (Casler and Shenk, 1985). The cause of this is that an increase in particle size increases the apparent path length for incident light and this increases the measure of reflectance. The milling of samples is a common procedure that provides a homogenous sample and has been shown to improve the accuracy of calibration models in predicting the nutritive quality of maize (Lovett, et al., 2005). Spectral pre-treatments such as Standard Normal Variate (SNV) and detrend (Barnes et al., 1989) have been developed to minimise the effects of particle size. No mathematical treatment can completely remove the adverse effects of particle size, however, these statistical methods help minimize the impact on the calibration models. 
2.13.7	Calibration strategy
NIRS is a secondary technique that requires the use of predictive calibration models to relate spectral data to reference data. This is achieved through the application of chemometrics to the spectra, with various approaches and no one approach being optimal for all circumstances. The classical approach is defined as the global approach; in which the calibration model is broad-based and can assess the majority of the variation that is encompassed in the calibration set. This can encompass several characteristics (e.g. species, moisture content, mixtures, tissue type etc) with the aim of encompassing a broad range of samples while maintaining accuracy (John, et al., 2007). Thus an important decision when designing calibrations is to define what variation in factors the model must encompass (Deaville and Flinn, 2000; John, et al., 2007).
Several authors have developed species-specific models from within a global approach that encompassed a number of forage species. They found these individual species-specific models were more accurate than the global model for some species and quality traits but not all. (Andueza, et al., 2011; Berzaghi, et al., 2000). These species-specific models are essentially global models but limited in the domain of analysis to a single species which eliminates the potential of bias between species that could occur while developing calibration models. So a prime decision in developing a calibration model is deciding what diversity in factors should be present in the calibration samples.
The local calibration strategy of (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991a) selects a number of user-defined samples, that are spectrally similar to the sample to be analysed, from a large sample-set. A partial least squares (PLS) regression is then used to develop a calibration model, so in essence an individual calibration is designed and tailored for each sample presented for analysis.
2.13.7.1	Population structuring
NIRS relies on predictive calibration model(s), thus the calibration set should ideally be representative of the future samples that will likely be analysed in practise (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991c). There is a potential trade-off between the accuracy of calibration models and the range in characteristics the model can be applied to (Deaville and Flinn, 2000; Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b; Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991c). In addition the cost and time associated with using a calibration set containing a large number of samples has lead to representative sub-sets of spectra being selected for analysis by the more costly reference methods. Shenk and Westerhaus (1991b) proposed two approaches to selecting a representative sample set for reference analysis and development of calibration models. Initially principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to the calibration set and the main principle components that explain the variation in the data. This provides structure and order to the calibration set. A computer program (CENTER) utilizes the mahalanobis distance (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b; Whitfield, et al., 1987) (global H) to assess the relative distance of the principle components of each spectrum from the mean principle components of all spectra. The mean distance of the all spectra from within the calibration set from the mean spectra is defined as gH 1.0. An additional method (SELECT) identifies spectra that are relatively close in hyper-dimensional space, based on PCA, and excludes them from the calibration set. This is achieved through the neighbourhood H statistic in which spectra that are closer than the minimum distance; all neighbours within this distance are eliminated so only the average spectra within this distance group remained. This process is repeated until there are no samples closer to each other than the minimum distance. Spectra which have a gH distance of 3.0 or less are recommended for inclusion into the calibration set as this is seen as a balance between included extreme samples and removing outliers (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b; Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991c). However care should be taken as excluding samples further than this may be valid extensions of the populations (e.g. with high or low moisture content) and these could be included to broaden the range of the calibration set, if required. Shenk and Westerhaus (1991c) validated this approach against a full calibration set and reported that the number of samples needing reference analysis could be reduced by up to 60% with a minimal loss in accuracy of calibration models.
2.13.7.2	Detection of outliers
The use of Mahalanobis distance has also been proposed as a method of identifying spectral outliers while analysing samples (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b). A Mahalanobis distance of 3.0 was proposed by Shenk and Westerhaus (1991b) as a balance between identifying true outliers while allowing samples to be analysed that are encompassed by the variation of the calibration set. The use of mahalanobis distance of 3.0 as identifying outliers has several weaknesses including unjustifiably restrictive dependence on the number of wavelengths and size of the sample set used in the development of the equation (Whitfield, et al., 1987). 
Mahalanobis Distance: 
D2 = (a - b) x M-1 x (a - b)’
where a are the individual’s values; b are the corresponding means from model values. Those values could be principle component scores. 
M^-1 is the inverse covariance matrix of the model values.
From Mark and Tunnell, (1985)
2.13.8	Chemometrics
Chemometrics is a broad category of statistical techniques that are involved in developing predictive calibration models (Geladi, 2003; Gislum, et al., 2004; Stuth, et al., 2003). Chemometric techniques in NIRS can be broadly divided into two main sub-sections;
•	Spectral pre-treatment
•	Regression techniques
2.13.8.1	Spectral pre-treatment
The spectrum of a sample is dependent on a number of physical and chemical factors including particle size (Casler and Shenk, 1985), scattering of light, path length, ambient temperature and ambient moisture. These factors are essentially noise in the spectrum (unless they are related to or are traits of interest) with the quantitative information on the nutritive quality traits also present within the spectrum (Cen and He, 2007). Spectral pre-treatments attempt to minimise the influence of this noise in the spectra, prior to the development of calibration models, through various mathematical approaches and algorithms.
2.13.8.1.1	Scatter correction
As path length is a constituent of the Beer-Lambert law, light scattering therefore has an effect of the measurement of the reflectance of a sample. Even within a sample there isn’t total uniformity in particle size and/or shape and this can cause light to scatter in several different forms (Figure 2.9; (Givens, et al., 1997).
 


The degree of scattering of a sample depends of the particle size, moisture content and temperature (Givens, et al., 1997). Barnes et al. (1989) suggested that the majority of variation in the spectra is due to non-specific scattering of radiation largely due to particle size effects rather than chemical composition thus contributing to noise within a spectrum. 
2.13.8.2	Standard Normal Variate and Detrending (SNV-D)
Barnes, et al. (1989) proposed the standard normal variate (SNV) and detrending (D) as a potential mathematical transformation of the spectrum that could separate variance due to physical (particle size) and chemical factors. SNV transformation is carried out on individual wavelengths and removes the slope variation within an individual sample. Over the near infrared wavelength region (1100 nm – 2500 nm) there is generally a linear trend of increasing absorbance (log 1/R) which can become curvilinear in densely packed samples. Barnes, et al. (1989) used a second degree polynomial to standardize the variation in co-linearity for detrending. Barnes, et al. (1989) showed that combing standard normal variate and detrend treatments removed more co-linearity than from applying individual treatments individually. 
2.13.8.3	Regression techniques
To provide a quantitative calibration of the NIR spectrum regression techniques are utilized that relate the reference data to the spectral information. The advances in computer processing power of the past 30 years have allowed chemometrics to interpret more information from the spectra. The absorbance bands are not solely due to one bond but the combination of several and may not be directly related. Regression techniques relate the spectra of up to several hundred samples with a know value for traits of interest (e.g. protein concentration) and relates them to their respective spectrum. This produces a calibration model that can be used to predict the nutritive quality of unknown sample(s), given their spectrum.
All multivariate regression techniques have the same basic form
Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + …+ bnXn
Where;
Y= the predicted variable
A = intercept
X1 – Xn = n independent variables
Bn = n regression coefficient
A number of mathematical assumptions are made when using regression techniques (Mark and Workman, 1991);
i.	Noise is assumed to be random for both the response and reference data
ii.	Errors in the reference and response data undergo a normal distribution
iii.	The error of the response data is small in comparison with the error in the reference data
iv.	Errors in response and reference data are independent of the magnitude of response and reference
v.	The mean of the reference is dependent on the value of response
vi.	The variance of the response is 0, while the variance of reference is identical for every value of response
2.13.9	Evaluation of calibration models
As calibrations models can be formed using a variation of spectral pre-treatments, regression techniques, various numbers of wavelengths in the model and for number of different constituents of interest evaluation criteria are key to ensure that robust and accurate calibration models are utilized (Westerhaus et al., 2004). 
There are a number of statistics commonly used in the evaluation of the performance of calibrations. No single statistic can be used in isolation to evaluate the performance of a calibration as acceptable performance limits may be influenced by the laboratory error of the reference technique and the acceptable limits of the users’ requirements. 
As NIRS is a secondary method that forms a prediction based on the calibration model the most commonly used statistics are the coefficient of determination (R2) and correlation coefficient (r). These are commonly linear regressions in which it is quantified how well the calibration model (X) predicts the reference data (Y) from which it was formed. The coefficient of determination can range from 0.0 – 1.0 and describes how much of the variation in the reference data (X) can be described from the calibration model (Y). An F-test for regression can be applied to assess whether the regression is statistically significant. 
2.13.9.1	Validation 
A cross-validation procedure has been enabled by the development of computer processing power and allows for what has been termed a ‘Monte-Carlo simulation’ (Foley, et al., 1998). In this the calibration model is divided into smaller sub-sets (usually fifths) and one fifth used as a prediction set while the remaining 4/5th are the calibration model. This process is repeated five times and provides an indication of how the model will perform when samples from outside the calibration set are applied to the calibration model. The standard error of cross validation (SECV) is calculated as the average difference between the reference method and NIRS prediction when part of the cross-validation set is examined
True validation also occurs, in which a prediction set that is outside the calibration set but is representative of the samples to be analysed by the model. These are assessed by both the calibration model and reference methods and the standard error of prediction (SEP) can be calculated by average difference between the reference method and NIRS prediction.
2.14	Current models
Numerous examples of calibration models exist throughout the literature for the nutritive quality (Jafari, et al., 2003; Roberts, et al., 2003) emphasising the importance this technology has become in breeding and evaluation programs (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010).
2.14.1	Digestibility
The early work of Norris, et al. (1976) showed the potential of NIRS to predict in vitro DMD of forage samples with a R2 of 0.77 at a SEP 5.1% of the mean. Digestibility is measured both in vivo and in vitro and poorly defined chemically in comparison to other nutritive traits commonly assessed by NIRS. As digestibility is a multifaceted property of the forage that involves both animal and plant factors, it is thus poorly defined chemically and likely limiting the accuracy of the calibration models The early research on digestibility was derived using multiple linear regression techniques of the spectrum without any knowledge as to which wavelengths contributed to the calibration models. Givens, et al. (1997) reported the wavelength regions 1650-1670nm and 2260-2280nm are the most important with regards to predicting digestibility. These regions of the spectrum have been show to be related to indigestible fractions of cereal straws (Givens, et al., 1992) and also important regions in relation to rumen degradation of grass and maize silages and also fresh grass (Deaville and Flinn, 2000). This work gives acclaim to the biological significance of these spectral regions as they are related to factors that are known to affect the digestibility of the forage.
2.14.2	Protein
The landmark paper of Norris, et al. (1976) showed that calibration models for CP concentration had the highest accuracy among several forage quality traits. This is consistent throughout the literature with calibration models having a R2 of greater than 0.97 (Agnew, et al., 2004; Gislum, et al., 2004; Park, et al., 1997). This is likely to be due to the strong N-H absorption bands in the NIR region associated with nitrogen content (Stuth, et al., 2003) and the relatively high concentrations of CP among forages (30-500 g/kg DM) (Roberts, et al., 2003). However, nitrogen has no direct absorbance band in the near infrared region and definition can’t be directly measured by NIRS. As previously stated, the most accurate calibration models are for assessing CP concentration (Jafari, et al., 2003; Roberts, et al., 2003) inferring a strong relationship between the N-H bond, that has an absorbance band in the NIR region, and the total N in a sample (John, et al., 2007; Roberts, et al., 2003).
2.14.3	Water soluble carbohydrate
Parnell and White (1983) first demonstrated the ability of NIRS to predict WSC in perennial ryegrass with an R2 of 0.92. The 2100 nm region of the spectrum is associated with carbohydrate and starch due to the O-H bond and C-H stretch combination found in carbohydrates (John, et al., 2007). More recent research by Agnew, et al. (2004) and Jafari, et al. (2003) has confirmed that calibration models can successfully predict WSC concentration (R2 = 0.98 -1.00) for perennial ryegrass herbage samples.
2.14.4	Intake Potential
NIRS calibration models have been developed to predict the short term voluntary intake of grazed grass (Agnew, et al., 2004). The authors reported that NIRS calibration models had an accuracy for secondary characteristics of the forage, such as intake potential (intake/h, R2 = 0.71,) compared to chemical constituents of a (WSC, R2 = 0.99). The standard error of the intake potential was c. 14% of the mean, however when comparing these to other studies using observational techniques it was around 12 %. 
Decruyenaere, et al. (2009b) developed concurrent NIRS calibrations for in vivo OMD and organic matter voluntary intake OMVI by comparing the forage offered with a subsequent faecal sample. The calibration models developed with faecal samples were of greater accuracy and had a lower SECV than forage calibration models. Decruyenaere, et al. (2009b) attributed this improvement in the calibration models to the fact that intake potential is not only dictated by the chemical composition of the forage but also dependent on physiological, metabolic and behaviour factors of the animal. These are impossible to measure through examination of the forage alone. Thus measuring the faecal samples encompassed some of these physiological and metabolic factors into the model and maybe even some aspects associated with behavioural differences.
2.15	Potential Applications 
A disadvantage of NIR spectroscopy is that it is a laboratory tool with the sample having to be brought to the instrument, limiting the application for field analysis. The advent of increased processing power and attachments specifically for field analysis being produced by manufactures is enabling real-time field spectroscopy to become an emerging tool in forage analysis. 
Two methods of analysis exist; (i) contact, in which the lens is brought to the sample or (ii) stand off where the lens is between 50 – 100 cm away from the sample. Stand off sampling has the advantage of using a wider area of the plot thus getting a more representative sample. 
Biewer, et al. (2009) have shown field spectroscopy has the ability to predict forage quality. When examining metabolisable energy, ash content, CP concentration and ADF of grass-legume swards ranging from 0 -100% clover content. The authors recorded R2 values ranging between 0.70 – 0.83 for all variables, with CP concentration having the highest R2 (0.83). Perbandt, et al. (2010) simulated the effects of cloud cover on field spectroscopy using a rack with five different layers of cotton to limit the radiation getting through to grass-legume swards. They found evidence of an interaction between the spectral response and cloud cover. However this is not a simple conclusion as the accuracy for herbage yield decreased with increasing cloud cover in calibration models developed with no artificial light however the opposite was reported for calibration models developed with the presence of artificial light. Thus the exclusion of solar radiation, by cloud cover, improved the calibration models and this has important implications for the development of this technology. Controlling prevailing weather conditions, were possible, such as the exclusion of solar radiation may be one such strategy to ensure these conditions are not a limiting the accuracy of calibration models. This is consistent with other findings from early work on field spectroscopy is limited due to prevailing weather and may require consistent atmospheric conditions or apply the approach of Biewer, et al. (2009) and ignore specific regions of the spectrum that are adversely effected by prevailing weather conditions.
2.16	Conclusion
NIRS is not an empirical method of measuring chemical composition but a secondary method that provides an estimate of chemical composition by using the near infrared spectrum of known samples to form a prediction calibration. NIR analysis makes predictions of chemical content or other characteristics by using a calibration model formed from infrared reflectance information on the physical and chemical nature of the sample. This allows the analyst to by-pass the traditional laboratory approach, which is almost always more time consuming and expensive by generating a predicted value using NIRS (Stuth, et al., 2003).
The particular functionality of NIRS makes it ideal for the implementation of a rapid and low sample cost tool, with relatively low operator expertise in routine sample processing, for determining the nutritive quality or other discriminating features among ryegrass varieties. Nonetheless, precise adherence to a defined procedure, particularly regarding sampling and sample preparation is vital as any alteration to the physical or chemical nature of the sample can alter the spectrum produced and thus the prediction of the constituent.
 
2.17	Objectives
The aims of this study were to;
i	Develop near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) calibration models to predict the nutritive quality in terms of four traits (in vitro DMD, WSC, CP and buffering capacity) of ryegrass swards from the national variety evaluation scheme for Ireland
ii	Compare the nutritive quality of three ryegrass species (Perennial, Italian and hybrid ryegrass) at two age of swards and throughout the growing season.
iii	Compare the nutritive quality of maturity, ploidy, age of sward of perennial ryegrass swards throughout the growing season.
iv	Investigate the potential to develop an optimal sampling protocol for assigning the nutritive quality of perennial ryegrass swards.
v	To develop and assess NIRS discriminant models to classify characteristics of samples (e.g. species, maturity, ploidy, age of sward, harvest year and harvest within year) to which the sample belonged.

3.1	Establishment of trials
3.1.1	Field plots
Field trials were carried out at the Grass and Clover Variety Evaluation Centre at Backweston, Co. Kildare, Ireland (53° 26' N, 06° 30' W; 50 m above sea-level; Figure 3.l). The soil type is a clay loam with a pH of 7.2 and 63 g/kg organic matter (Grogan & Gilliland, 2011). These trials were carried out for the Grass and Clover Recommended List Varieties for Ireland (DAFM 2012) under an established protocol (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011).

3.1.2	Plot management
Variety trials were primarily arranged by species whereby perennial ryegrass was arranged into three separate maturity group trials (early, intermediate and late) based on mean date of ear emergence. Italian and hybrid ryegrass trials were arranged in trials together in all sowings with the exception of 2007 when they were managed as separate trials. Within perennial ryegrass, both intermediate and late groups were sown in each year while the early group was sown in alternate years. In the alternate year between early perennial ryegrass trials being sown, Italian and hybrid ryegrass trials were sown (Figure 3.2).

In late summer, plots (7.0 m x 1.5 m) were sown as monocultures of ryegrass varieties in the year prior to first harvest at a sowing rate of 31.0 kg/ha and 41.0 kg/ha for perennial ryegrass diploids and tetraploids respectively and for Italian or hybrid ryegrass trials at 41.0 kg/ha or 51.0 kg/ha for diploid or tetraploid plots, respectively. Within each trial, plots were sown in a randomised complete block design with four replicate blocks. Inorganic nitrogen fertilizer was applied at an annual rate of 350 kg N/ha in all harvest years except 2006 when 400 kg N/ha was applied. An initial 40 kg N/ha was applied in February and with 100 – 110, 90 – 110, 50 – 60, 35 – 45, 25 – 35 kg N/ha applied sequentially after the first five harvests (Table 3.1).

In each harvest year, plots underwent a combined simulated grazing and conservation management (Table 3.2). The first harvest was targeted for early April, however if there were good growing conditions early in the growing season an additional harvest may have been taken prior to April. Each maturity group was harvested individually based on the productivity on plots, with a maximum gap of one week between early and late groups. The initial harvest(s) simulated spring grazing and the next two simulated conservation harvests taken at seven and six week re-growth intervals, respectively. The final three harvests simulated grazing and were then taken after four, five and six week re-growth intervals. These were the targeted harvest intervals throughout the study, however the targets were adjustable over the course of the study to reflect the altering weather and growing conditions. In the harvest year 2007 an additional cut was taken prior to the April cut to reflect the growing conditions of that year. Plots were harvested to a stubble height of 5 cm above ground level using a Haldrup harvester (Haldrup, Logstor, Denmark; Figure 3.3) and herbage yield was estimated via an on-board weighing scale. A circa 300 g sample from each plot was oven dried at 80oC for 16 hours to determine dry matter (DM) concentration. These were subsequently milled (Retch SM 100) through a 1 mm pore sieve, prior to further analysis.

3.1.3	Biotic material
A total of 19 trials from six sowings were examined in this study (Figure 3.2). This comprised x varieties, Y samples etc etc – show table of varieties/trial/year/species and quantify total sample numbers for each and the grand total for the study. Maybe quote that this data set was sub divided into specifically related groupings depending on the investigation being conducted, as described in the following chapters – or something like this. You need to find a nice term or all of this – like the “Total Reference Set” or “Total Sample Set” (for each species/type), so you can refer back to it
3.2	NIRS 
Absorbance spectrum (log 1/reflectance) was measured was measured from between 400 – 2500 nm at 2 nm intervals on a NIRsystems 6500 or a standardised NIRsystems XDS (Foss UK Ltd., Warrington, UK) using ISIscan software (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda, PA, USA) from a sub sample from each harvested plot. The spectrum of each sample (Figure 3.4) was stored for developing calibration models (Chapter 4) and used to assess the quality traits based on the calibration models.

3.3	Laboratory analysis
In this study four quality traits were examined, in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration and buffering capacity. In order to develop NIRS calibrations (Chapter 4) for these traits 2056 samples from the total sample set were analysed in the laboratory by standard wet chemistry methods. 
•	Buffering capacity was measured according to Playne & McDonald (1966).
•	 CP concentration (N x 6.25) was determined using method 990-03 of the Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 1990) with a LECO FP-428 (Leco Corporation, St. Joseph, MI, USA). 
•	In vitro DMD was assessed using the two-stage technique of Tilley & Terry (1963) modified by the final residue being isolated by filtration, 
•	The automated anthrone method (Thomas, 1977) was used to determine WSC concentration.
3.4	Meteorological data
Meteorological data was accessed from Met Eireann weather station at Casement aerodrome, situated less than 5 km from Backweston. Ireland is situated in the Atlantic north and Atlantic central environmental zone (Trnka, et al., 2011) which is particularly suited to grassland productivity at an estimated total output of 70-75 t DM/ ha. The climate in Ireland is highly seasonal with the highest temperatures being observed in the summer (June – August) with highly variable temperature patterns around the over-year means, particularly at the spring and autumn fringes of the growing season (Table 3.4 – 3.6). Rainfall is prevalent in all months, with August and November being particularly wet, however high levels of rainfall have the potential to occur in any month (Table 3.3). In the winter months sunshine levels are low and on average December and January get less than 2 hours per day (Table 3.6).

CHAPTER 4


4	DEVELOPMENT OF NEAR INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY (NIRS) CALIBRATION MODELS TO PREDICT RYEGRASS NUTRITIVE QUALITY
 
4.1	Introduction 
NIRS is a secondary technique that relies on the use of an appropriate combination of chemometic techniques to develop an optimal strategy for developing calibration models (Geladi, 2003; Givens, et al., 1997; Stuth, et al., 2003) A global strategy is typically applied and uses all samples from the calibration set and should encompass as much of the variability that the model will likely face in practise, as is possible (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b). The calibration set from the current study contained three species and additional sources of variation (e.g. age of sward, seasonal developmental stage) that may potentially limit the accuracy a global strategy.
Research by. Berzaghi, et al. (2000) and Andueza, et al. (2011) has shown that the local calibration strategy of Shenk, et al. (1997) is potentially more accurate when the calibration set contained several forage species that could introduce non-linear relationships that potentially limit the accuracy of a global strategy. The current study contains three species (L. perenne, L. multiflorum and L. boucheanum) that may potentially introduce a bias between the calibration models and the quality traits. A third strategy, species-specific, develops calibrations for individual species from within the global calibration to remove the bias between species, but they can potentially lower the variation encompasses within the calibration models. This provides justification to assess the potential of each of these three calibration strategies for assessing the nutritive quality of ryegrass varieties.
4.1.1	Objective
The objective of this study was to develop optimal calibrations models for the assessment of four nutritive and ensilability quality traits of ryegrass herbage. A comparison of three calibration strategies (Global, species-specific and Local) and various chemometirc approaches were assessed with the aim of developing the most accurate calibration models for assessing in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration and buffering capacity of ryegrass.

A calibration set a total of 2056 samples (Table 4.1) was examined and this comprised XX % of the total sample set. These samples encompassed the range in climatic conditions, species, maturity, ploidy, genotype and age of sward occurring at this site over six sowings.
4.2.2	Calibration strategy 
Three calibration strategies were applied to the calibration set;
•	Global strategy, in which all the samples within the calibration set were used to develop calibrations for each of the quality traits.
•	Species-specific strategy, in which only the spectra of the relevant species was used to develop calibrations for each of the quality traits, and 
•	Local strategy, in which a number of spectrally similar samples to the unknown sample were selected and an individual calibration model developed for each sample and quality trait.
4.2.2.1	Global strategy
The NIRS calibrations were independently developed using all 2076 from the calibration set (Table 4.1). Chemometric techniques were applied to the NIR spectra using WinISI version 4.00 (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda, PA, USA). Calibration models were developed across the wavelength range 1108-2498 nm at 2 nm intervals. Permutations of several different chemometric techniques were applied to the spectra to form the calibration models. The spectra had two spectral pre-treatments, each with two options, applied prior to application of regression techniques: 
(i)	a scatter correction treatment of standard normal variate and detrending (SNV-D; Barnes et al. 1989) was applied to spectra or no scatter correction treatment was applied,  
(ii)	a curve smoothing of 1,4,4 or 2,5,10 derivations was carried out on the spectra, where the first value denotes the derivate, the second value denotes the gap over which the derivate is calculated and the third value denotes the number of data points. 
Three regression techniques (Modified partial least squares, partial least squares, principal component regression) were then used to relate the reference data to the spectra. These combinations of spectral pre-treatments and regression techniques resulted in 12 permutations of calibration models per quality trait (Appendix A). Outliers were removed from each calibration model on the basis of chemical residual T > 2.5 or spectral global H > 10.0 using the WinISI software. 
4.2.2.2	Species specific strategy
For the species specific strategy the full calibration set (n = 2076) was divided into a subset for each individual species (Table 4.1): perennial ryegrass (n = 1836), Italian ryegrass (n = 137) and hybrid ryegrass (n = 103). The same approach for the global calibration was applied to each of these individual subsets (Appendix B).
4.2.2.3	Local calibration strategy
A standard normal variate and detrend (Barnes, et al., 1989) and a 1,4,4 derivation were applied to the spectra prior to calibration development. The local algorithm of Shenk (1997) was used in which principle component analysis is initially applied to the calibration set. Following this, an individual calibration is formed for each sample and quality trait whereby either 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 or 250 samples (k) were selected based on the closeness in hyper dimensional space. Subsequently a multiple linear regression model was developed using the k samples to predict a value for the sample in question. This process was repeated for each individual sample so effectively an individual calibration set is generated for each sample.
4.2.3	Laboratory analysis
Each of the 2076 samples were analysed for four nutritive quality traits (in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration and buffering capacity) using laboratory methods described in Chapter 3.
4.2.4	Cross-validation 
A cross-validation procedure was carried out for each of the calibration models to provide an indication of the robustness of each model and provide a more reliable indication of accuracy of the models when applied to a sample outside of the current calibration set. A cross-validation was carried out in which a random 4/5 of the full calibration set was used to form the calibration models and the remaining samples were used as a validation set. The cross-validation procedure was carried out five times and the mean of the cross-validation procedures calculated. Optimal calibration models were selected on the basis of high R2 and low standard errors of cross-validation.
4.3	Results
The four calibration models of the global strategy that provided the most accurate and robust cross-validation statistics are displayed in Table 4.2 along with a summary of similar published calibration models. The most accurate calibration model was for predicting CP concentration (R2 = 0.98), with WSC concentration and buffering capacity calibration models also being accurate (R2 = 0.96, 0.95 respectively). The in vitro DMD calibration model was slightly less accurate (R2 = 0.86). Calibration models from all three strategies were quite accurate, with regression coefficients (R2) above 0.94 in all cases, with the exception of in vitro DMD for a global strategy(R2= 0.864), local strategy (R2 = 0.792) and species specific strategy for perennial ryegrass (R2= 0.788), and for the weighted average within the species specific strategy (R2= 0.810) (Table 4.3).The species specific calibration strategy produced similarly accurate estimates of each quality trait to the global strategy. Applying the local strategy generally provided the poorest estimation of the three strategies, with in vitro DMD having the weakest estimates (R2= 0.710-0.792) and CP the strongest (R2= 0.946-0.970). Comparing the individual species within the species specific strategy, the accuracy of estimations was relatively similar between species except for the in vitro DMD estimation in perennial ryegrass, which was the weakest estimation. Interestingly, this appeared to be associated with the poorer estimate of in vitro DMD of the global strategy. The local strategy was most accurate when estimating CP & WSC concentration and buffering capacity, and in some comparisons it approached the accuracy levels of the other two strategies, but never exceeded them. Overall, a global strategy produced the most accurate models for in vitro DMD and CP and was of similar accuracy to both species specific and local strategy for WSC and buffering capacity.
4.4	Discussion
A comparison of the global strategy with similar figures in the literature (Table 4.2) demonstrates that the accuracy of the current calibration models were within the range of those previously published. The most accurate calibration models were for predicting CP concentration (R2: literature = 0.93 – 0.99; current study = 0.98). As CP concentration is a measure of nitrogen content this could be due to the strong N-H bonds, that are linked to nitrogen content, being displayed in the absorbance spectrum of the sample (Roberts et al., 2004). The lower R2 of in vitro DMD in comparison to the other three quality traits may be related to it incorporating additional variation due to animal factors being involved (Coleman & Moore, 2003). The in vitro DMD calibration (R2 = 0.86) was within the range of accuracy in other published work (R2 = 0.83 – 0.96). The accuracy of these calibrations was satisfactory considering the larger calibration size (n = 1986; 90 outliers removed from full calibration set) compared to the other studies (n = 49 – 193).

The accuracy of all calibration models for the species specific strategy for Italian and hybrid ryegrasses was higher than the species specific strategy for perennial ryegrass or the global strategy with the exception of the species specific model for hybrid ryegrass . Both Berzaghi et al. (2000) and Andueza et al.(2011) also found a species specific strategy produced the most accurate calibration models for some individual forage species. It is evident that the inclusion of the Italian and hybrid ryegrass (i.e. global strategy) to the species specific approach for perennial ryegrass expands the range (Table 4.1) and distribution (standard deviation 36.9, 73.7, 70.7 for perennial, Italian and hybrid ryegrasses, respectively) of in vitro DMD values. This could potentially account for the increased accuracy of the global strategy in comparison to the perennial ryegrass species specific calibration model. However, similar standard deviation figures were present for WSC; with a lower standard deviation for perennial ryegrass samples than for both other species with the resultant global and species specific strategies of similar accuracy. For CP concentration and buffering capacity the distribution of values (obtained by standard laboratory techniques) between species was quite similar (Table 4.1) and this may have lead to the similar accuracy of the species specific and global strategies.  Berzaghi et al. (2000) and Andueza et al. (2011) reported the increased accuracy of a local calibration strategy in comparison to a global strategy for predicting forage quality traits in calibration sets that encompassed several forage species. The greater accuracy of the global strategy in comparison to the local strategy in the current study may be attributed to the lack of bias and non-linear relationships that existed between monocultures of three species within the same genus (Lolium), whereas Berzaghi et al. (2000) and Andueza et al. (2011) had a larger range of diverse forages (including ryegrass, red clover, lucerne, corn silage, haylage, small grain silage and total mixed ration) which could have potentially limited the performance of their global calibration models. The use of a global strategy may therefore be more appropriate when most variation is encompassed with little bias between factors in the model.
4.5	Conclusions
As the global calibration models were highly accurate for all nutritive and ensilability quality traits and species they were used for all subsequent analyses in this study (Chapters 5 & 6). The global models encompassed more of the variation that these models will potentially encounter in additional sowings and harvests, and thus will likely confer a greater robustness than the species specific models.

 

CHAPTER 5


5	EFFECT OF LOLIUM SPECIES ON THE NUTRITIVE QUALITY OF RYEGRASS
 

5.1	Introduction
Varieties from three ryegrass species (L. perenne, L. multiflorum and L. boucheanum) are recommended for use in Ireland (Dafm, 2012). Thus a comparison of the herbage yield and nutritive quality of all three species is necessary to facilitate the optimal use of the most favourable species to match individual farming enterprise requirements.
Although measuring animal productivity provides a more direct estimate of the animal output potential of a sward, this is unfeasible in large scale variety evaluation schemes due to the high resource requirement, associated cost and experimental error (Camlin, 1997; Orr, et al., 2003; Orr, et al., 2001a). Instead, the use of nutritive quality traits can provide a reliable estimate of the animal productivity potential of the sward (Beever, et al., 2000; Casler, 2000). 
5.1.1	Objective
 The objective of this study was to assess the differences in four quality traits (in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration and buffering capacity) and herbage yield between three ryegrass species (L. perenne, L. multiflorum and L. boucheanum) of one and two year old swards from a national variety evaluation scheme.
5.2	 Materials and Methods 
This study was conducted over three sowings (2001, 2005, 2007). Trials were preliminary managed based on species; in the 2001 and 2005 sowings Italian ryegrass and hybrid ryegrass were managed in the same trial and in 2007 sowing Italian and hybrid ryegrass plots were managed in separate but adjacent trials. Perennial ryegrass plots were also managed in separate but adjacent trials that were divided into two maturity groups (intermediate and late heading). Sowing rates, cutting regime and fertilizer application as described in Materials and Methods (Chatper 3).

n = number of varieties x sowings (some varieties were sown in more than one year)

A total of 868 plots were examined from the trials sown in 2001, 2005, 2007. The 2001 and 2005 sowings were harvested in two subsequent years and the 2007 sowing harvested for only one subsequent year, on 6-7 occasions throughout the growing season, resulting in a total of 8400 harvested plots (Table 5.1). From each of these harvested plots a c. 300g sub-sample was taken and analysed using the NIRS global calibration models as described in Chapter 4.
5.2.1	Statistical analysis
The results from the cuts within a year were grouped as follows: Spring – all cuts taken up to 17 April; Silage 1 –cut taken on approximately 22 May; Silage 2 –cut taken on approximately 10 July; Rest of year – combines the cuts taken on approximately 7 August, 11 September and 23 October. Annual herbage yield was the cumulative total of the individual harvest values while annual herbage quality trait values were the average of the individual harvest values weighted by herbage yield. Due to poor growing conditions the cut 1 in the 2006 harvest year was not sampled. 
A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis was employed for herbage yield, DM concentration and quality traits (Table 5.4 – 5.8); with fixed effect terms for harvest year, species, maturity, ploidy and random effect terms for trial, variety within trial and variety within block within trial. Individual terms were added to the full fixed model and then species dropped from the full mixed model to assess the significance. Statistical analysis was carried out independently for one and two year old swards. Where a significant effect of species occurred, a student t-test was applied to each paired species combination to assess the significance between paired species.

In the first harvest year there was a significant species effect as perennial ryegrass was lower yielding than both hybrid or Italian ryegrass and this was also evident at all seasonal periods with the exception of  the ‘Rest of Year’ period were differences which (Table 5.4). No significant annual difference existed in DM concentration (Table 5.4), however species had an effect in each seasonal period with perennial ryegrass having a higher concentration of DM at ‘Spring’ (P<0.05) than both Italian

or hybrid ryegrass swards. This relationship was reversed at ‘Silage 1’ and ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.001) and in the ‘Rest of Year’ (P < 0.05). The in vitro DMD of perennial ryegrass swards was higher than both other species at ‘Silage 2’ (P<0.001), ‘Rest of Year’ (P < 0.001) and ‘Annual’ (P < 0.001), but only significantly higher than Italian ryegrass in ‘Spring’ (P < 0.05) with no significant effect at ‘Silage 1’ (Table 5.3). An effect of species on WSC concentration was approaching significance (P = 0.054) at the ‘Annual’ period (Table 5.4) and significant at ‘Silage 1’ (P < 0.01) where both Italian and hybrid ryegrasses had significantly higher WSC concentration than perennial ryegrass. A significant effect was also present at ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.001) where perennial ryegrass swards had a higher WSC concentration than both Italian and hybrid swards. Perennial ryegrass had a significantly higher buffering capacity (Table 5.5) and CP concentration (Table 5.6) at ‘Silage 2’, (P<0.001), ‘Rest of Year’ (P<0.001) and ‘Annual’ (P<0.001, P<0.01, for buffering capacity and CP, respectively) periods and it also had a higher (P<0.001) buffering capacity at ‘Silage 1’.
5.3.2	 Two year old swards
In their second year of harvest Italian and hybrid ryegrasses still had significantly higher annual herbage yields than perennial ryegrass (Table 5.2). No significant effect of species was present at ‘Silage 1’, ‘Silage 2’ or ‘Rest of Year’ periods but species had an effect at the ‘Spring’ period (P < 0.01) when Italian ryegrass swards had a higher herbage yield than both perennial or hybrid ryegrasses. At the ‘Silage 1’ (P < 0.001) and ‘Annual’ (P < 0.01) periods perennial ryegrass had a significantly lower DM concentration than both Italian and hybrid ryegrasses (Table 5.2), this relationship was reversed at ‘Spring’ (P > 0.05), while at the ‘Silage 2’ and ‘Rest of Year’ periods Italian ryegrass had a significantly higher DM concentration than both other species. No significant effect of species occurred on the in vitro DMD at the ‘Spring’ or ‘Silage 1’periods (Table 5.3). At both the ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.001) and ‘Rest of year’ (P < 0.001) periods a significant effect of species occurred with each individual species significantly different from each other in terms of in vitro DMD, and at the ‘Annual’ period Italian ryegrass swards were significantly lower than both other species. The WSC concentration of perennial ryegrass swards was lower than both other species at the ‘Silage 1’ period (P < 0.001); however this order was reversed at the ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.05) period with perennial ryegrass plots having a higher WSC concentration and no significant difference occurring at any other seasonal period or annually (Table 5.4). At the ‘Annual’ period each species had a significantly different buffering capacity (Table 5.5), however the relationship varied through the growing season with no significant effect at the ‘Spring’ period.

5.4.1	Herbage yield
In the current study Italian and hybrid ryegrass had an additional 21%, more herbage yield than perennial ryegrass in the first year after sowing and this is in line with previous results (Gilliland and Mann, 2001; Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). This supports the recommendation of Italian and hybrid ryegrass varieties for increased silage yields for short-medium term use (Camlin, 1997). However, Wilman and Gao (1996) found hybrid ryegrass swards to be the lowest yielding in their first harvest year with Italian ryegrass swards the highest yielding. This may have been a varietal effect as only one variety was used to represent each species in their study, particularly if the hybrid variety was a strong ‘perennial-type’. In the second harvest year of the current study, Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards maintained their higher herbage yield than perennial ryegrass but with a slightly reduced advantage of 18%. This is in agreement with (Gilliland and Mann, 2001), however it is in contrast to (Wilman and Gao, 1996) who found perennial ryegrass swards to have significantly higher yields in their second harvest year, and over the course of five harvests perennial ryegrass swards had a 6.6% increased herbage yield. Although not measured in the current study, the persistence of perennial ryegrass is generally greater than both Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards (Camlin, 1997). Wilman and Gao (1996), in a separate trial, demonstrated the increased tiller density of perennial ryegrass swards over Italian ryegrass swards over the course of three years.

However, Gilliland and Mann (2001) found a similar rate of decline in productivity for all three species over five harvests. As is widely accepted, the evaluation of these ryegrass species needs to also account for the long term performance when assessing productivity potential.
5.4.2	 Quality traits
Wilman, et al. (1996) found perennial ryegrass to have the highest digestibility of eight grass species that included Italian and hybrid ryegrasses, over two harvests years, and similar findings have been reported on recommended list trials (Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). The results of the current study confirm these results with perennial ryegrass swards having the highest in vitro DMD in the first harvest year and higher than Italian swards in the second harvest year. However these findings are in contrast to Kemešytė and Lemežienė (2010) who found that both Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards had a significantly higher in vitro DMD in the early spring of their first harvest year. Both of these previous studies used only one variety so it is unclear as to whether this difference was a characteristic of the individual species or a varietal effect, although other environmental and management factors may also have had an influence. 
Wilman, et al. (1996) found Italian ryegrass swards had a higher WSC concentration than perennial ryegrass, although in their study hybrid ryegrass had the lowest WSC concentration. The in vitro DMD of perennial ryegrass swards has been correlated with WSC concentration (Humphreys, 1989c), however the higher in vitro DMD of perennial ryegrass swards was not reflected in the results for WSC, as both Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards had a higher WSC concentration in their first harvest year. 
The CP concentration of perennial ryegrass was generally higher than Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards, and for all three species the CP concentration remained above the 80 g/kg DM threshold required for successful rumen function (Coleman and Moore, 2003). The overall relatively high CP concentrations reflect the application of fertiliser N (350-400 kg per annum) (Binnie, et al., 2001; Peyraud and Astigarraga, 1998). These high concentrations of CP, in excess of ruminant demands, may result in excess urinary N excretion and result in soil N losses as nitrate to ground water or as nitrous oxide (Peyraud and Astigarraga, 1998). Thus, an important issue when considering CP concentration is the WSC:CP balance, as the optimal WSC:CP ratio of forage in the rumen may result in a greater conversion of forage protein to ruminant product through increased nitrogen use efficiency by the ruminant (Evans, et al., 2011; Miller, et al., 2001; Parsons, et al., 2011). The WSC: CP ratio of the current study was 1.23, 1.47, 1.50 for perennial, Italian and hybrid ryegrasses, respectively, in their first harvest year and 1.51, 1.65, and 1.54 in the second harvest year. A review on the WSC:CP ratio was carried out by Parsons, et al. (2011) which detailed perennial ryegrass swards having a ratio of between 0.5 – 2.5. These data were generated from several studies and the level of nitrogen application heavily influenced the CP concentration of the sward and at higher levels of nitrogen application to get a fixed response in the WSC:CP ratio required a higher level of WSC in the forage. Thus, at the high level of nitrogen application in the current study the use of Italian and hybrid ryegrass varieties may result in a more optimal balance of energy and protein that could result in the greater nitrogen use efficiency. Across all species there was a weak trend for higher CP concentration to parallel lower herbage yield in the one year old swards (R = -0.192; P < 0.001) and a stronger trend in two year old swards (R = -0.623; P < 0.001) suggesting similar uptake of N but different efficiencies of conversion to herbage yield.
Hybrid ryegrass can display the characteristics of both its Italian and perennial ryegrass parentage (Gilliland and Mann, 2001; Jones and Humphreys, 1993). The current study would suggest that productivity and quality traits from Italian parentage are more prevalent within the current hybrid population as the hybrid progeny tended to be more similar in herbage yield, WSC & CP concentrarion and buffering capacity to Italian ryegrass swards than to perennial ryegrass swards. Jones and Humphreys (1993) suggest that hybrid ryegrasses tend to display characteristics more strongly from their Italian heritance until ear emergence has occurred, during the remainder of the growing season traits from their perennial parentage tend to dominate. From the current findings, it was difficult to draw any clear cut conclusions regarding the parental contribution to the traits displayed as the results report an average of several hybrid varieties. The management scheme of the current study may also have influenced the herbage yield and quality trait results as Italian and hybrid ryegrasses were harvested more than a week earlier than perennial ryegrass swards, reflecting the earlier maturation of Italian and hybrid genotypes. However, even within species there is a range in heading dates that will influence the optimal management of an individual variety (Gilliland, 1995).
5.4.3	Ensilability
Although post-harvest practices will greatly influence the subsequent efficiency of conservation as silage (Conaghan, et al., 2008c; Keady, et al., 2000), grass ensilability at the time when a crop is harvested is an important factor in determining the animal productivity potential of the ensiled forage. This ensilability can be assessed based on a combination of grass WSC concentration, expressed on an aqueous phase basis to account for the dilution of fermentable substrate by water, and buffering capacity. 
When averaged across both simulated silage harvests and the three ryegrass species, herbages in their first year after sowing had poorer ensilability characteristics (44 g WSC/L; 359 mEq/kg DM) than was recorded in the following year (61 g WSC/L; 351 mEq/kg DM). This effect of lower WSC concentration (g/L) may have reflected the higher growth rate of herbage in the first year after sowing.
Although, on average, herbage harvested for Silage 1 had better ensilability characteristics than herbage for Silage 2 (62 vs. 44 g WSC/L, despite 373 vs. 337 mEq/kg DM), this masked considerable variability among species and age of sward. This is as expected since prevailing weather conditions have such a marked effect on both WSC (g/kg DM) and DM (g/kg) values (Roche, et al., 2009).
When averaged across age of sward and both simulated silage harvests, perennial ryegrass had poorer ensilability characteristics (43 g WSC/L, 387 mEq/kg DM) than Italian (60 g/L, 330 mEq/kg DM) ryegrass, with hybrid ryegrass being intermediate (56 g/L, 349 mEq/kg DM) but more similar to Italian ryegrass. This advantage for Italian ryegrass agrees with Wilson and Collins (1980) who reported that when ensiled under standardised conditions Italian ryegrass underwent a satisfactory lactic acid dominant fermentation more frequently than perennial ryegrass.
5.5	Conclusions 
These results from samples taken from the recommended list trials in Ireland confirm previous studies that show Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards had an increased productivity over perennial ryegrass swards in the initial years after harvest (Camlin, 1997; Gilliland and Mann, 2001). Perennial ryegrass swards had the highest in vitro DMD and this is consistent with previous work (Wilman, et al., 1996). The higher WSC of Italian and hybrid ryegrasses resulted in a higher WSC:CP ratio that could potentially have a beneficial effect on the nitrogen use efficiency within ruminants. The range in productivity, nutritive quality and ensilability traits across these three species provides different forage options to meet the requirements of a wide diversity of ruminant production systems and has the potential to contribute to a more productive and efficient farming sector.
 

CHAPTER 6


6	EFFECT OF PLOIDY, MATURITY AND AGE OF SWARD ON THE NUTRITIVE QUALITY OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS
 
6.1	Introduction
Within the Irish Recommended List, perennial ryegrass varieties are categorised into three maturity groups based on mean heading date (Dafm, 2012), and these groups differ in their suitability for meeting specific farming requirements (Frame, 1991; Gilliland, 1995; Laidlaw, 2004). Varieties are also categorised as either diploid or tetraploid and each of these types also has its own niche role in farming enterprises (Gilliland, et al., 2002; Smith, et al., 2003). 
An understanding of the relationships between maturity and ploidy groupings for herbage yield and quality traits of perennial ryegrasses from a national variety evaluation scheme would facilitate the selection of varieties particularly suited to specific farm enterprise requirements.
6.1.1	Objectives
The objective of this study was to assess the differences in the four quality traits (in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration and buffering capacity) and herbage yield for maturity; ploidy and age of sward groups among perennial ryegrass varieties.

Figure  6.1: Schematic outline of sowing and harvest year schedule used for Analyses A and B

The current study comprised five sowings (2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006) and with each new set of plots harvested in the two subsequent years except for the sowings in 2002 and 2004 when only one subsequent harvest year was available for analysis (see Figure 6.1). A total of 1208 plots were sown across the five sowing years. Each of these plots was harvested 6 – 7 times throughout a growing season, in one or two harvest years resulting in a total of 11 580 plots harvested.
In each harvest year, plots underwent combined simulated grazing and conservation management as per materials and methods (Chapter 3), where-by each maturity group was harvested individually based on the productivity on plots, with a maximum gap of one week between early and late groups. A c. 300 g sub-sample from each harvested plot was taken and analysed for each of the four quality traits using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Chapter 4). 
6.2.2	Statistical analysis
As all varieties were not sown every year, the data were analysed using two separate analyses to optimise the use of information from the database. Analysis A comprised both the intermediate and late groups sown in 2001, 2005 and 2006 and harvested in each of the two subsequent years (Figure 6.1). Analysis B comprised the early, intermediate and late groups sown in 2002, 2004 and 2006, and harvested in one of the two subsequent years (Figure 6.1). This facilitated Analysis A assessing age of sward effects while having a larger sample size for assessing the effects of ploidy. Analysis B facilitated a comparison of the early group with the intermediate and late groups.
For Analysis A, 170 variety units (unique variety within a sowing year) were sown (Table 6.1) and harvested in the two following years resulting in a total of 8412 plot harvests. Analysis B comprised of 195 variety units (of which 63 were present in Analysis A) harvested in one of the two years following sowing resulting in 4404 plot harvests (of which 1512 were present in Analysis A).
As different varieties were at different stages along their evaluation cycle during this study not all varieties were present in each sowing. This resulted in 13 varieties that were common to the three years of sowings for Analysis A and 21 that were common to each of the sowings for Analysis B. The results from the harvests within a year

+A variety unit is defined as a unique variety within a sowing year (i.e. if a variety is sown in another year then it is a separate variety unit)

were grouped as follows: Spring – harvests taken up to 17 April; Silage 1 – harvest taken on approximately 29 May; Silage 2 – harvest taken on approximately 10 July; Rest of year  – combines the harvests taken on approximately 7 August, 11 September and 23 October. Annual herbage yield was the cumulative total of the individual harvest values while annual herbage quality trait values were based on the appropriate individual harvest values averaged using a weighting for individual harvests derived from their respective DM contributions to annual yield. Due to poor growing conditions the first harvest in 2006 produced herbage yields below the reliable tolerance limits of the on-board weighing scales and less than was required for nutritive analysis so these samples were not included in yield or quality traits. 
Analysis A comprised intermediate and late groups in a REML analysis with fixed effect terms for harvest year, maturity, ploidy and age of sward and random effect terms for trial, block within trial, and variety within block within trial. A trial is defined as the maturity group within a sowing year (Figure 6.1). Individual terms were added to the full fixed model and then maturity, ploidy, age of sward and maturity x ploidy interaction were individually dropped from the full mixed model to assess the significance of each individual term. The random terms ensured that the effect of age of sward was tested against the error estimate at the age of sward within variety within block within trial level of the data. Analysis B included the early, intermediate and late groups with a REML analysis carried out, effectively on the trial-by-variety means, with fixed effect terms for harvest year, maturity and ploidy and random effect terms for trial and for variety within trial. Individual terms were added to the full fixed model and then maturity, ploidy and maturity x ploidy interaction were individually dropped from the full mixed model to assess the significance of each individual term.
Where a significant effect of maturity occurred in Analysis B, a student t-test was applied to each paired combination of maturity groups to assess the significance between groups.

6.3	Results 
6.3.1	Maturity
Within Analysis A, maturity had no significant effect on herbage yield (Table 6.2), in vitro DMD (Table 6.3), WSC concentration (Table 6.4), CP concentration (Table 6.5) or DM concentration (Table 6.7) at any individual seasonal period or for the annual value. For buffering capacity the only effect was for the ‘Annual’ period where the intermediate group had lower (P < 0.05) values than the late group with the same relationship approaching significance (P = 0.053) at ‘Silage 1’. However, with the inclusion of the early group (Analysis B), maturity had a significant effect on herbage yield at the ‘Rest of Year’ period (P < 0.05) with the early group having the lowest yield (Table 6.2).

In Analysis B, maturity also had an effect on in vitro DMD at the ‘Spring’ (P < 0.01) period, with the late group being significantly greater than the early group, and at the ‘Annual’ period (P < 0.01) period where the late group was significantly higher than either the early or intermediate groups (Table 6.3).

A significant maturity x ploidy interaction occurred for in vitro DMD in Analysis A at the ‘Spring’ (P < 0.01), ‘Silage 1’ (P < 0.01), ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.05) and ‘Annual’ (P < 0.05) periods (Table 6.3) whereby intermediate diploids had lower values than intermediate tetraploids (783 vs. 795 g/kg, respectively). The only other significant maturity x ploidy interactions for Analysis A were at ‘Spring’ for WSC concentration (P < 0.001) and CP concentration (P < 0.01), and ‘Annual’ for DM concentration (P < 0.05).

Tetraploid swards had greater herbage yields (P < 0.001), in vitro DMD values (P<0.001) and WSC concentrations (P < 0.01) than diploid swards at all seasonal periods and annually. An exception to the above occurred for herbage yield in the ‘Spring’ period where the difference was not significant (Table 6.3).

Diploid swards had higher CP and DM concentration (P < 0.001) than tetraploid swards over the growing season. This relationship occurred at all seasonal periods for DM concentration (Table 6.7) and at ‘Spring’ (P<0.001), ‘Silage 2’ (P<0.05) and ‘Rest of Year’ (P<0.01) periods for CP concentration while no significant effect was found at ‘Silage 1’ (Table 6.5).
Diploid swards had a significantly higher buffering capacity than tetraploids swards at ‘Spring’ (P < 0.01), but a lower value at the ‘Silage 1’ (P < 0.001), ‘Silage 2’ (P < 0.05) and ‘Rest of Year’ (P < 0.001) periods and at ‘Annual’ (P < 0.05) period (Table 6.6).
6.3.3	Age of sward
In their first full season swards had a higher herbage yield at ‘Spring’ (P < 0.001) and ‘Silage 1’ (P < 0.05) than in their second season. This resulted in a higher annual herbage yield (P < 0.001) in the first season after sowing (Table 6.2).

Age of sward had no effect (P > 0.05) on in vitro DMD, WSC, CP or DM concentration except for WSC concentration at ‘Silage 2’ when one year old swards had a higher value (P < 0.01; Table 6.4). One year old swards had a higher annual buffering capacity than two year old swards (P < 0.05) reflecting higher (P < 0.05) values in the ‘Spring’ and ‘Silage 2’ seasonal periods, but with no significant difference occured at either the ‘Silage 1’ or ‘Rest of year’ periods (Table 6.6).
6.4	Discussion
6.4.1	Maturity
Although perennial ryegrass varieties are categorized into maturity groups, the mean heading date of varieties forms a continuum (Gilliland, et al., 2002). The use of groupings reduces the span in heading date between varieties being harvested together, so as to reduce the differences in developmental stage when defoliated and optimise the effect of intrinsic varietal performance potential differences (Weddell, et al., 1997).Aldrich and Dend (1963) have previously shown that there are differences in seasonal yield distribution across this continuum. The results of the current study confirm this as there were only significant seasonal yield differences at ’Silage 1’. It is noted however, because the three maturity groups were cut at relatively similar times there is an underlying influence of differences in developmental stage at harvest on these comparisons. Even within a maturity group, such underlying effects can’t be entirely avoided unless each variety is harvested at the exactly the same developmental stage. The current results were, however, in contrast to the studies by Gilliland, et al. (2002) and Laidlaw (2005) who found earlier groups to have a higher herbage yield in early April, corresponding to the spring period of the current study. They also found that the late group had a higher herbage yield in the summer period coinciding with the timing of the silage cuts in the current study. Similarly, the lack of significant difference between the maturity groups for total annual herbage yield is in contrast with Gilliland et al. (2002) who found a significant difference in the annual herbage yield of the three maturity groups and both Gowen, et al. (2003) and O'donovan and Delaby (2005) who found the late group to have a higher annual herbage yield than the intermediate group in grazed swards.
The current study imposed a different management regime to any of these previous studies as it did not involve animal grazing and tested a much larger and different set of varieties (43-69 varieties annually compared to 9-12 in the previous studies). As Gilliland and Mann (2000) have shown, the management regime imposed on the sward can significantly affect productivity patterns and strong genotype by environment interactions are also know to occur for productivity (Conaghan, et al., 2008a) and quality traits, particularly WSC concentration (Evans, et al., 2011). This highlights the challenges when evaluating varieties for agronomic use and the limitations in extrapolating results from variety trials onto farm level, as reported by Conaghan, et al. (2008a).
When the nutritive value traits were compared between maturity groups a number of significant differences were found. At ‘Silage 1’, intermediate and late groups had significantly higher in vitro DMD than the early group. This is an important observation as first-cut silage contributes the most conserved forage of any harvest in the growing season in Ireland (Connolly, et al., 2002). This suggests it may be possible to grow varieties from the late maturing group to a higher yield than earlier maturing types, while still maintaining an adequate digestibility, and this is in accord with Humphreys and O'kiely (2006).
A significant increase in WSC concentration was also recorded at ‘Silage 1’ and this likely contributed to the differences in in vitro DMD at this harvest. There are, however, other important implications of increased WSC concentration. When WSC concentration is expressed on an aqueous phase basis and considered together with buffering capacity (DM basis) they provide a good index of ensilability (O'kiely and Muck, 1998). The overall mean WSC and buffering capacity values among all ‘Silage 1’ and ‘Silage 2’ herbages (49 g WSC/litre and 367 mEq/kg DM) indicate that crops had a considerable surplus of fermentable substrate and should have been quite straightforward to properly preserve as silage. Herbage maturity group had no overall impact on ensilability at the ‘Silage 2’ harvest, with the lower WSC concentration among the early group (45.7 g/l) than among the intermediate (55.4 g/l) or the late (59.2 g/l) groups being offset by the correspondingly lower buffering capacity values associated with the early group (i.e. 322 versus 349 and 408 mEq/kg DM, respectively). Thus, maturity categorisation had no impact on ensilability. Across all three maturity groups, the ensilability indices of herbages from ‘Silage 1’ indicated they would be easier to preserve than ‘Silage 2’ herbages.
Notably, there were no significant differences in CP concentrations between maturity groups. Binnie, et al. (2001) have shown that high application rates of inorganic N fertilizer can raise CP concentration, with the relatively high rates in the current study (350 – 400 kg N/ha per annum) possibly masking any differences that might exist between maturity groups. In addition, as perennial ryegrass is known for its high CP concentration, with swards normally exceeding the 80 g CP/kg DM concentration thought to be limiting to rumen function (Coleman and Moore, 2003), the lack of differences may also reflect the low priority of CP as a trait for ryegrass breeders (O'donovan, et al., 2011).
6.4.2	Ploidy
Gilliland, et al. (2007) reported an increase in the usage of tetraploid varietiess of perennial ryegrass over the past 25 years in Northern Ireland, and these now account for almost 0.3 of all perennial ryegrass seed sold. This increased usage was attributed to the perceived increased yield potential and nutritive value of tetraploid varieties. This advantage was repeated in the current study as tetraploids conferred a small but statistically significant herbage yield advantage at all seasonal periods except ‘Spring’ which gave a total yield increase of 0.66 t/ha per annum. This was similar to the findings of Gilliland, et al. (2002) who found no seasonal differences between ploidies but an additional 1 t DM/ha per annum from tetraploids. Under animal grazing conditions, however, Gowen, et al. (2003) and Balocchi and Lopez (2009) found diploids swards to have a higher annual herbage yield than tetraploids. Although additional environmental and management factors are likely to affect the yield potential of diploid and tetraploid swards, these inconsistencies raise concern regarding how representative simulated-grazing is of actual grazing. This is clearly not a simple issue as Wims, et al. (2010) found no significant re-ranking of varieties when comparing animal grazed and simulated grazed plots.
The higher nutritive value of tetraploid varieties is well established (Balocchi and Lopez, 2009; Gilliland, et al., 2002; Wilkins, 1991), although it is unclear as to the mechanism(s) that induce higher nutritive value. A proposed explanation is that the increased ratio of cell contents to cell wall in tetraploids allows for increased intra-cellular components without a proportional increase in potentially lower nutritive value cell wall material (Wilkins and Sabanci, 1990). However this possible explanation cannot be the single causal factor as the CP concentration of tetraploids was found to be lower. 
The increased in vitro DMD of tetraploids as shown throughout the growing season in the current study may be partially attributed to the increased WSC concentration (Humphreys, 1989c). However, it could equally have been due to a decrease in fibrous material (O'donovan, et al., 2011) or a change in fibre digestibility.
The increased WSC concentration of tetraploids may have resulted in the decreased CP concentration. Smith, et al. (2001) reported altered carbon partitioning between intra-cellular components in grass varieties bred for high WSC concentration.
Tetraploid varieties are often suggested as being optimal for ensilage, reflecting the higher yield potential under mechanical harvested systems and the increased WSC concentration. At ‘Silage 1’, the higher DM and lower WSC (g/kg DM) concentrations associated with diploid compared to tetraploid varieties meant that when expressed on an aqueous phase basis the WSC concentrations were numerically quite similar (42.0 and 41.9 g/l for diploids and tetraploids, respectively). Although buffering capacity was lower for the diploid varieties, the magnitude of this effect was very small (434 vs. 441 mEq/kg DM). At ‘Silage 2’, the higher DM and lower WSC (g/kg DM) concentrations associated with diploid compared to tetraploid varieties meant that when expressed on an aqueous phase basis the WSC concentrations were 35.9 and 34.2 g/l, respectively. There was no effect of ploidy on buffering capacity. In terms of ensilability indices the increased WSC concentration of tetraploids is effectively counteracted by the decreased DM concentration when WSC concentration is reported on an aqueous phase basis. Although ‘Silage 1’ diploids had a marginally lower buffering capacity the effect of ploidy on silage fermentation is likely to be minimal. 
6.4.3	Age of sward 
As a sward ages, its yield and quality has been shown to decrease due to the invasion of secondary grasses and weeds (Wilkins, 1997). The current study had a decrease of 31 % between the one and two year old swards, however it is unclear whether this was a result of weather conditions in the year of harvest, age of plant material or the residual effects of soil fertility and structure following sowing (Parsons, et al., 2011). There was, notably, no decline in digestibility and little deterioration in other nutritive quality traits between one and two year old swards with the only difference being WSC concentration at ‘Silage 2’. Here again it is possible that the high application rates of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer masked any deterioration in CP concentration, as Keady, et al. (2000) have shown that increasing the application rate of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer increases the CP concentration in the sward.
Age of sward did not affect ensilability at ‘Silage 1’, while at ‘Silage 2’ the slightly higher WSC values in one year old swards (36.3 vs. 33.8 g/l) was counterbalanced by a correspondingly higher buffering capacity (385 vs. 367 mEq/kg DM). Thus, there was little indication of any effect of age of sward on grass ensilability.
It is noted however that the current study only examined swards up to two years after sowing and with the longer term effects of sward aging cannot be reliably predicted from the current data set.
6.5	Conclusions
The main conclusions from this work were that significant differences exist between ploidy and maturity for herbage yield, nutritive quality traits and ensilabiltiy indices. This provides justification for the use of these groups in evaluation trials as they permit like-for-like comparisons between varieties. It also shows that despite breeders’ achievements in creating considerable differences between individual varieties, as evident in recommended list publications, ploidy and maturity group characteristics remain an influence on performance. The seasonal differences between maturity groups at the first silage cut suggests that timing this harvest differently for the three groups in the variety trials might better reflect best management practice. The detectable sward age effects between the first and second harvest years could be the start of a progressive decline in performance of swards following sowing or equally evidence that the first year after reseeding does not reflect the longer term potential of perennial ryegrass swards. A longer term study of sward age should easily resolve which of these two possibilities is the causal factor of this observation.
 

CHAPTER 7


7	EXPLORATION OF THE POTENTIAL TO IMPLEMENT AN OPTIMAL SAMPLING PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS QUALITY TRAITS ON A NATIONAL VARIETY EVALUATION SCHEME
 
7.1	Introduction
National variety evaluation schemes obtain a large amount of information on the productivity, nutritive quality and persistence of individual perennial ryegrass varieties for making recommendations for use in ruminant-based production systems (Dafm, 2012; Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). These evaluation schemes are under a fixed annual reporting cycle with limited resources to achieve their aims (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010), thus time and cost are constraints for obtaining and analysing data. As theses constraints limit the amount of data that can be utilized for making recommendations, important decisions need to be taken regarding the optimal allocation of resources and priority of agronomic traits. 
Replication in variety evaluation schemes serves several purposes; within a trial it provides an assessment of the variance associated with experimental error, allowing statistical comparisons between varieties. Increasing the replication enables smaller varietal differences to be detected as statistical significant and decreases the likelihood of false positive differences (Smith and Kearney, 2002). Replication also serves as a contingency policy to ensure that data is still present even if a loss occurs in one block or location (e.g. pests, extreme weather events, germination failure). 
Varietal evaluation is often carried out across several environments (e.g. season, location, year) to ensure that environmental conditions during the assessment of varieties are representative of the target conditions (i.e. on farm) (Smith, et al., 2005). This is achieved through several sowings, over a number of years and locations, and harvesting throughout the year and over a number of years (Conaghan, et al., 2008a; Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). Genotype x environment interactions often occur, with the implication that the assessment of varieties in one environment may not be representative of another environment (Conaghan, et al., 2008a; Smith, et al., 2005). 
The aim of an evaluation scheme is to assess the relative phenotypic merit of a variety in a number of agronomic traits; however varietal ranking for nutritive quality traits may not be consistent across all environments (Smith, et al., 2005). For the purposes of evaluation schemes the relative performance (i.e. ranking) of varieties is more important than the absolute performance as this is only relevant to the test site and conditions. Thus crossover interactions (i.e. rank changes) between environments are of primary concern to variety evaluation schemes as they provide an indication of the consistency of ranking across several environments (Conaghan, et al., 2008a). 
As perennial ryegrass is a perennial crop and harvested over several years, age of sward has an effect on the nutritive quality and productivity of the sward (Camlin, 1997). Thus assessment over several ages of sward acts as a form of additional replication but also provides an assessment on the genotype x age of sward interaction which is an important consideration for the long-term agronomic value of the sward (Conaghan, et al., 2008a).
The optimal allocation of resources for the assessment of varieties is paramount. If similar information can be obtained using less resources this enables these resources to be allocated to assessing additional genotypes, environments, traits of interest and/or additional species.
7.1.1	Objective
The objective of this research was to assess the potential of a sampling protocol with reduced replication requirement to obtain a reliable estimation of the relative performance of perennial ryegrass varieties for each of five quality traits (in vitro DMD, WSC & CP concentration, buffering capacity, DM).
7.2	Material and Methods
7.2.1	Plot management
Fifteen perennial ryegrass varieties (Table 7.1) were selected for further evaluation from within all varieties sown (Chapter 3). These varieties were from two separate maturity groups (intermediate-heading, late-heading) and sown in three separate years (2001, 2005, 2006) in a randomized complete block design (4 blocks). All trials were sown within 500 m of each other. Each trial was harvested in the two subsequent years following sowing under a 6-cut combined simulated grazing and conservation management scheme as per Material and Methods (Chapter 3). A c. 300 g sub-sample was taken from each plot at each harvest and used to assess DM content and for NIRS analysis of in vitro DMD, WSC concentration, CP concentration and buffering capacity (Chapter 4).

7.2.2	Statistical analyses
For information on the variance components of genotype and genotype x environment interactions an analysis of variance was carried out using the following model in SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA);
Yijklm = μ + Mh + M(A)hj + YM(A)hjm + Y(M)Bhkm + M(G)Hi + G(M)Bhik + G(M)Yhij + GYM(A)hijm + εhijklm
where μ = the grand mean, Mh = effect of maturity,  Bk = the effect of blocks, Aj = the effect of age-of-sward, Ym = the effect of sowing year, Gi = the effect of genotype, and εhijklm = the residual error. 
Age-of-sward represented the number of harvest years after sowing and its levels were 1-year or 2-yearr of age. Maturity and age-of-sward was considered to have a fixed effect, while the effects of genotype, block, location, sowing year and all interactions were considered to be random. Genotype effects were considered random because they were representative of the population of varieties marketable in Ireland. Variance components were estimated from expectations of mean squares. Negative components of variance were considered as zero. Variance and significance of each factor was tabulated for each nutritive quality trait and were carried out for each individual cut and overall annual value.
7.2.2.1	Spearman rank correlation
For an estimation of the effect of age of sward, genotype means within a trial (averaged across blocks) were calculated within each maturity group These genotype means were used to assign the ranking in ascending order at each of the six cuts in the harvest year 2007 for both one and two year old swards. A spearman rank correlation was calculated between the ranking of the of one and two year old swards at each cut. The mean spearman rank correlation between maturity groups was calculated and presented. This process was carried out for each of the five quality traits.
For an estimation of the effect of weather varietal ranking was calculated in ascending order, based on the genotype means within a trial for each maturity group at each cut. A spearman rank correlation was calculated between each pair of trials from different calendar years at the same age of sward. The spearman rank correlation coefficients were pooled across maturity categories and standard errors and standard deviation calculated across all trials for each cut. This process was repeated for each of the five nutritive quality traits.
To assess the effect of block the varietal ranking was calculated in ascending order for each block with a trial. A spearman rank correlation was calculated between each pair of block within trial. This process was repeated for each of the five nutritive quality traits.
7.2.2.2	Selection criteria
The ‘definitive’ ranking for each quality trait was calculated as a weighted average, by herbage yield, of all data available (i.e. sowings, ages of swards and blocks) for each individual cut and the annual figure for each maturity group. (Appendix C - G).
An assessment of the effect of selection criteria (block, age of sward and sowings) on the definitive varietal ranking was carried out. To achieve this all combinations of selection criteria were assessed (Table 7.2). For each combination of selection criteria a mean value was calculated as a weighted average of the component selection criteria.
Table 7.2: Combinations of selections criteria
Sowings	Age of sward 	Permutations blocks* 
1 sowing	1 age of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
1 sowing	Both ages of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
2 sowings	1 age of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
2 sowings	Both ages of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
3 sowings	1 age of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
3 sowings	Both ages of sward	1, 2, 3 or 4
* see text for explanation
All permutations of each of the selection criteria were assessed, for example one sowing at one age of sward for two blocks had each individual sowing (2001, 2005,2006) assessed at each age of sward (one or two year old) for the six permutations of two blocks (1+2, 1+3, 1+4, 2+3, 2+4, 3+4). This resulted in a total of 18 different permutations of 1 sowing, 1 age of sward and 2 blocks for each maturity group. The ranking of each of these permutations was calculated and the spearman rank correlation was carried out between each of these permutations, and the definitive ranking was calculated. The average of all permutations was calculated and also the standard deviation and standard error of this average calculated and pooled across maturity groups. This process was repeated for each combination of selection criteria, at each individual harvest for each of the five nutritive quality traits (Appendix H - L).
7.3	Results
The genotype x environment interactions were complex and varied. (Table 7.3 – 7.7). For all quality traits the two greatest sources of variation were year by maturity within an age of sward and the experimental error. This was the case for all cuts and the annual value. For in vitro DMD (Table 7.3) and buffering capacity the greatest source of variation was year by maturity within an age of sward at all cuts and annual value with the exception of cut 3. For WSC concentration (Table 7.4) and concentration of DM (Table 7.7) the greatest source of variation was year by maturity within age of sward at all cuts and seasonal periods and for CP at all cuts with the exception of cut 2 (Table 7.5). The genotype within maturity group was a significant source of variation for all nutritive quality traits at all cuts and annual figure with the exceptions of buffering capacity at cut 3 (Table 7.6). 
The spearman rank correlation between one and two year old swards was generally poor (Table 7.8). When considered on an annual basis, DM concentration had the strongest correlation (r = 0.83) of all the quality traits, with the other traits ranging from 0.39 for buffering capacity and to 0.67 for in vitro DMD. The highest correlations between one and two year old swards tended to occur at cut 1, 5 and 6. The highest correction between one and two year old swards occurred at cut 1 for in vitro DMD and WSC, at cut 5 for CP and dry matter and at cut 6 for buffering capacity (Table 7.8). 
In vitro DMD and concentration of DM had the highest spearman rank correlation between calendar years for each of the individual age of swards (Table 7.9), where the correlation for in vitro DMD was 0.75, 0.62 and for DM concentration was 0.70 and 0.80 for one and two year old swards, respectively. 
Overall the spearman rank correlation between individual blocks was generally poor for each nutritive quality trait at each cut, ranging from 0.05 – 0.68 (Table 7.10). The quality trait with the lowest correlation between blocks was CP concentration (r = 0.05 -0.30). In vitro DMD and concentration of DM had the highest correlation at each cut and annual period, with the exception of cut 1 where WSC concentration had the highest correlation (r = 0.68).
In all incidences there was a positive spearman rank correlation between combination of selection criteria with the definitive ranking. This was true each of quality traits at all cuts (Figure 7.1 – 7.5). Increasing the number of blocks within a sowing and age of sward combination generally had a positive sigmoidal response, whereby for each block added there was a tendency for an increase in correlation but the rate of increase was smaller for each additional block. (Figure 7.1 – 7.5), where exceptions to this did occur they tended to be at the 1 sowing and 1 age of sward combination. 
For each combination of blocks the order of sowing and age of sward combinations that had the highest correlation with the definitive ranking was three sowing with both ages of sward, two sowings and both ages of sward then three sowings and one age of sward. Two sowings with one age of sward tended to have a greater correlation with the definitive ranking than one sowing and two ages of sward.  The one sowing and one age of sward combination almost always having the poorest correlation with the definitive ranking (Figure 7.1 – 7.5).
Given a spearman rank correlation coefficient threshold of 0.9 there is a number of combinations of selection criteria that meet this threshold. Given three sowings and two ages of sward, dropping one block would be an acceptable strategy at all cuts and annual figure for in vitro DMD (Figure 7.1). If reporting on an annual basis three sowings with any combination of age of sward and blocks, with the exception of the three sowings 1 age of sward one block combination, would meet the acceptable threshold. The selection criteria combinations of two sowings one ages of sward with either three of four blocks and two sowings two ages of sward and either two – four blocks combinations also meet the acceptable threshold (Figure 7.1).
For WSC concentration Cut 3 tended to have the lowest correlations for each combination of selection criteria and no combination other than a combination of selection criteria (i.e. the definitive ranking) would reach the acceptable threshold. Considered on an annual basis both ages of sward would be require with either two - three sowings and three – four blocks to meet the acceptable threshold (Figure 7.2).
The only opportunity to reduce the selection criteria while maintaining an acceptable correlation for CP correlation was for using all sowings and ages of sward at Cut 2, 5 and 6, whereby the only scope to reduce replication was the removal one block (Figure 7.3).
For buffing capacity the silage cuts (Cut 2 and 3) are of prime concern. At each of these cuts there was no combination of selection criteria other than all combinations of selection criteria (i.e. definitive ranking) are required to meet the acceptable threshold (Figure 7.4).
DM concentration was the only quality trait where one sowing could provide an acceptable estimate of varietal ranking. This occurred for the combinations of one sowing two ages of sward and either three or four blocks at Cut 5 and annual value and for one sowing two ages of sward and four blocks at Cut 6 (Figure 7.5). On an annual basis any combination of selection sowings for two age of sward greater with more than one sowing would require three or four blocks would provide an acceptable estimate of varietal ranking (Figure 7.5).
7.4	Discussion
An assessment of the components of variance provides an indication of where replication should be targeted to ensure the accurate varietal comparisons are made to account for this variation. The level of experimental error also contribute to the likelihood of reporting a significant difference between two varieties which may not be a response of the variety (i.e. false positive) (Smith and Kearney, 2002). Smith and Kearney (2002) carried out a review of seven variety evaluation schemes for perennial ryegrass and reported that the least significant difference (P < 0.05) for discriminating between varieties for herbage yield ranged from ranged from 4 – 255 % of the mean. Further study would be required to assess the influence of decreasing the number of selection criteria on the least significant difference as this could influence the number of false positive results that occur.
At each Cut and for each nutritive quality trait there was a relatively large genotype x year x age of sward component of variation (Table 7.3 – 7.7). This would suggest that the effects of genotype, weather and age of sward and their interactions were inconsistent and that a sampling protocol need to encompass replication across several sowings and over both ages of sward. Conaghan, et al. (2008a) reported similar findings for perennial ryegrass and reported an added interaction with location when assessing G x E interactions of herbage yield at five sites in Ireland. 
The high level of variation for genotype x year x age of sward resulted in inconsistent varietal ranking between harvest years and also between ages of sward. This is in agreement with previous forage studies across several environments (Casler and Boe, 2003; Conaghan, et al., 2008a; Smith, et al., 2005). This emphasises the importance of carrying out varietal trials throughout several environmental conditions and over both ages of sward as the varietal ranking is not always consistent throughout these conditions. An issue for the evaluator is how interpret this data, with the goal of providing recommendations of individual varieties to various farming enterprises that encompass several environmental conditions. The varietal ranking over all environments may not be equivalent as that in some environments (or any), however it will provide a broad recommendation across a range of environmental factors (Smith, et al., 2005).
An additional factor is that perennial ryegrass leys often last for much longer than two years (> five years) (Camlin, 1997), thus an important factor should be to assess how the short term performance (two-year) evaluation of varieties compares to the situation on farms. As the varietal ranking of one year old swards was not highly correlated with two year old swards, this suggests that varietal rankings of these two ages of sward may not be correlated with the long term performance of the varities. Gilliland and Mann (2000) assessed the herbage yield ranking of perennial ryegrass varieties across three harvest years and similarly found ranking changes between age of sward. They suggested that the third year is likely to more indicative of the long term performance of the sward and thus should have a higher weighted as it provides a better indicator of the true agronomic potential of a variety.
The variance component association with block was relatively low for each quality trait. It is somewhat surprising therefore of the poor varietal ranking correlation that occurred between blocks with no correlation greater than 0.68 and the annual value ranging from 0.05 – 0.57. In all cases there was a high level of experimental error which would have contributed to the ability to detect differences between varieties.
An additional factor contributing to the low level of correlation between blocks may be that these 15 varieties are from an elite germplasm, with the estimated genetic gain in dry matter yield of 0.3-0.4 % per annum (Chaves, et al., 2010; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003) and 0.55 % for digestibility (Pendergrast, et al., 2011). Thus varietal differences in nutritive traits may be relatively small and a small degree of experimental error may be sufficient to cause a significant amount of re-ranking. Thus the use of blocks as a form of replication should also be considered as equally important as these provide an assessment of the variation between varieties within trials and allow for a statistical inference to be made between varieties. Therefore a requirement for replication using several blocks would be a requirement to minimise the potential for false differences due to experimental error.
Smith and Kearney (2002) carried out an experiment in which a 16 % apparent difference in herbage yield between a new variety and already listed was only significantly detected 45 % of the time based on four blocks. When then number of blocks was increased to eight there was a 70 % success rate. Further analysis would therefore be required to assess the effect that the number of blocks on the least significant difference. This would enable an estimate of the level of varietal difference between varieties before a significant improvement can be established and also provide an indication of the likelihood of false positive results.
Casler (1999) suggests that a poor varietal ranking correlation between environments infers that trials have be carried out in a wider range of environmental conditions, than if this were not the case. As these conditions are likely representative of the farming enterprises, evaluating across several environments provides a more robust assessment as this encompasses the likely environmental conditions to be faced. It is therefore likely that these trials faced several environmental conditions that would reflect the target conditions on farms.
The ranking of varieties was not consistent across calendar years at each age of sward for each nutritive quality trait (Table 7.9). The in vitro DMD and DM content rankings were the most consistent between calendar years. This would suggest that these traits are less influenced by prevailing weather conditions than the other three traits. Wilkins (1997) established that there was a large effect of variety, irrespective of maturity or environment on the in vitro digestibility of perennial ryegrass, however it is somewhat surprising for the concentration of DM as this is known to be heavily influenced by prevailing weather conditions (Roche, et al., 2009). Although the absolute value for concentration of DM is likely to be influenced by prevailing weather conditions the current results would suggest that varietal ranking remained relatively constant. The variation in ranking between calendar years for each of the traits would provide justification for the evaluation of nutritive quality to be carried out across several years.

As well as the statistical implications choosing the optimal balance of sowings, age of swards and blocks, it is also imperative to consider the financial and time implications of such decisions (Casler, 1999). For the selection of an additional sowing or age of sward requires the same time-frame, however the sowing process is an additional cost but provides an assessment of the year of sowing effects. The longer the evaluation process the more the commercial life of the varieties is delayed, providing an increased penalty that the breeding program must endure. Sowing in several locations is also a key attribute of national variety evaluation schemes and the cost of maintaining equipment and plots on several sites is considerable (Conaghan, et al., 2008a). The authors report that the effect of location and harvest year on the DM yield ranking of varieties is inter-changeable, thus the evaluation over several locations could provide sufficient information on the genotype x environment interaction, however, this study was reported over three calendar years of relatively similar weather conditions. Given recent climatic trends for increasing weather differences between years are more prevalent, the use of different locations to account for environmental conditions may not be as reliable as assessing across a number of years.
Another consideration when assessing several nutritive quality traits is the relationships between traits. A loss in performance in one trait may be compensated for by an improvement in another. This has been displayed in a trade-off between productivity and digestibility (Gilliland, 1995; Humphreys and O'kiely, 2006). This would be of particular interest to grass breeders who aim to obtain increased nutritive quality traits without a negative trade-off in other traits. 
7.5	Conclusions
Although there was a low level of variation associated with block, for each quality trait and at each cut, there would be a requirement for replication using preferably three or four blocks to provide an accurate assessment of varietal ranking. If quality traits were to be considered on an annual basis there was potential to use three blocks with all sowings and ages of sward for each traits, with the exception of CP concentration which would require the use of all blocks. This would result in a 25 % reduction in the number of samples required for analysis; however the time savings of this sampling protocol would be negligible as the most of the time is associated with sowings.
There was a poor correlation between one and two year old swards and as the ‘definitive’ ranking is an average of one and two year old swards it may be the cause that neither individual age is a reliable estimate of combined average. In almost all cases, within the same number of sowings, the use of both the ages of sward resulted in higher correlations with the ‘definitive’ ranking than using one age of sward assessment. In addition the use of both ages of sward may also provide a more reliable estimation of the long term performance potential of the sward. Using both ages of swards but requires twice the amount of samples to be processed than on using one of the two individual ages of sward. 
If considered on an annual basis, for all quality traits, at least two sowings would be required to provide an accurate estimate of the varietal ranking with the exception of CP concentration where all three sowings would be required. This adds strength to the current protocol whereby at least two sowings are used prior to any recommendation being made.
When comparing the two sowings with one age of sward with one sowing and two ages of sward, the correlation of varietal ranking was greater increased using two sowings. However there would be an additional cost associated with the extra sowing and this is a consideration that must also be taken into account. 
In conclusion, there is scope to explore a sampling protocol with a reduced level of replication. A number of genotype x environment factors contribute to the variance within estimates and it is likely that at least some replication will be required in sowings, ages of sward and block to account for this. Evaluators must also consider the financial and practical considerations of any statistical protocol and through the optimal allocation of replication there is scope to obtain a higher level of accuracy on fixed resources or the freeing up of resources for additional priorities.

CHAPTER 8


8	DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS OF RYEGRASS CHARACTERISTICS USING NEAR INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY
 
8.1	Introduction
NIRS discriminant models have the potential to provide a replacement for some of the forensic tools that are currently used to classify forages. The classification of species is often carried out using morphological keys but their use requires high levels of plant taxonomy expertise and there is a significant risk of misclassification between morphologically similar species (Fermanian and Michalski, 1989). For the gaining of plant breeders rights, new tested varieties must be ‘distinct’ from that already present on the EU common catalogue of varieties (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010). This is achieved through a form of discriminant analysis based on seven visual and twelve measured traits (e.g. plant width, plant height at spring, heading date) for perennial ryegrass varieties (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010). This is an expensive and slow procedure, taking several years to complete (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010). Gel electrophoresis of proteins, enzymes and DNA fragment and base pair polymorphism has been used for classification of existing varieties and for comparing relative genetic distances between varieties and species (Wallace, et al., 2010). These require highly specialised skills and are expensive tests to conduct. Current methodology for categorizing ryegrass varieties is thus a time-consuming and resource intensive task. In contrast, NIRS could offer a rapid and cost-effective technology with minimal skill requirements from the operator, once the discriminant model has been developed. (Givens, et al., 1997). 
8.1.1	Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate if the near infrared spectrum can be utilized to develop discriminant models to successfully identify the characteristic (species, ploidy, maturity, age of sward, harvest year, harvest within year and variety) to which the spectrum belongs.
8.2	Materials and Methods
All samples underwent the trial management and NIRS protocol as described in Chapter 3.

HD – Heading Date
To ensure the most balanced design and maximise the number of spectra for each individual discriminant model, three datasets were used (Dataset A – C). Dataset A comprised 15 perennial ryegrass varieties (Table 8.1) which were sown as monocultures in intermediate- and late-heading trials from three sowings (2001, 2005, 2006) and harvested in each of two subsequent years. This dataset was used for developing the following discriminant models; Ploidy , Age of sward, Harvest year, Cut and Variety.
Dataset B facilitated a comparison of the three perennial ryegrass maturity groups (early-, intermediate- and late-heading) and was based on six varieties per maturity group and comprised one sowing in 2005 with two subsequent harvests (Table 8.1).
Dataset C facilitated a species comparison between perennial, Italian and hybrid ryegrass whereby five varieties per species were utilized and comprised one sowing in 2006 and two subsequent harvest years. 
The legacy ISI PLS 2 discriminant analysis  was applied using WinISI (v. 4.0 FOSS UK Ltd., Warrington, UK), whereby membership to a correct group is given a value of 2.0 and others have a value of 1.0. A 2-block partial least square regression was performed to assign each spectrum to a group. Spectra are assigned to a group based on the highest PLS score, whereby a score of 2.0 would be a perfect classification and a value of 1.0 assigned to all other group classifications. A confidence factor was calculated for each spectrum where highest PLS score amongst the other groups was subtracted from the classified score. In the perfection classification a confidence factor of 1.0 would be found.
A cross-validation procedure was carried out for each of the three datasets whereby each dataset was randomly divided into fifths. 4/5th was used to form the discriminanat models and the remaining 1/5th used as a validation set. This process was repeated five times to ensure each sample was in a validation set and the total number of correctly classified samples was recorded.

Perennial ryegrass had the highest successful classification rate amongst the three species (96 %), with Italian ryegrass (81 %) intermediate and hybrid ryegrass the lowest rate (59 %). This was mirrored in the confidence factors (Table 8.2), whereby the same order was observed (0.672, 0.273, 0.130). Of the mis-classified Italian ryegrass samples, 99 % were mis-classified as hybrid ryegrass and 84 % of the mis-classified hybrid ryegrass samples were identified as Italian ryegrass (Table 8.3).

8.3.2	Ploidy
Overall the discriminant model for ploidy had a high success rate for correct classification (87 %; Table 8.2). Successful classification rates were similar for both diploid (86 %) and tetraploid (88%) samples (Table 8.4). The average confidence factor for each group was greater than 0.51 indicating a considerable difference picked up in the spectra between these diploids and tetraploids.

The successful classification rate of maturity was similar for the early (93 %) and late groups (94 %) but a lower rate was found for the intermediate group (77 %). This was mirrored in the confidence factor, whereby the intermediate group had the lowest (0.292) compared to the early (0.533) and late groups (0.585). When misclassification occurred it tended to be to adjacent maturity groups; 95 % of misclassified early and 90 % late group were classified as intermediate with the misclassified intermediates being spilt 45 % late and 55 % early groups (Table 8.5).

Age of sward had the highest classification rate (96 %; Table 8.6) of all the discriminant models and also the highest confidence factor. The classification rate was similar for 1 year old (95 %) and two year old (96 %) swards and both had similarly high confidence factors (0.739 and 0.764 respectively).
8.3.5	Harvest year
Discriminant models for harvest year were highly successful, with all years having a classification rate of greater than 93% (Table 8.2). The harvest year 2003 had a 100% success rate with no false positives (Table 8.7). Of the misclassified samples from harvest 2007, the majority were from 2006 and 2008 accounting for 50% and 47% of misclassified samples respectively.

Cut 1had a 100% classification rate, however it is noted that no 1st harvest data was present from 2006 (Table 8.2). Where misclassification occurred, it tended to be to the previous or subsequent cut(s); with 80 %, 71%, 92 %, 67 % and 60 % of misclassified samples occurring to adjacent harvests at Cut 2 , 3, 4 ,5 and 6 respectively (Table 8.8).

The discriminat model for variety were the most varied, with a classification rate ranging from 7 – 88 % (Table 8.9). No profound patterns emerge when samples are misclassified, however AberCraigs, the most successful classified variety (88%), also had the highest level of false positives with a greater number of false positive classifications (202) than actual AberCraigs samples (n = 148;Table 8.10).
8.4	Discussion
The spectrum on a sample is formed by the relative absorbance of near infrared light by chemical bonds within the sample (Cen and He, 2007). Therefore the spectrum provides information on the underlying chemical composition of the sample and it is likely that differences in chemical composition are key factors in discriminating between groups.
8.4.1	Species
Differences in the chemical composition between these three species are well established (Frame, 1991; Wilman, et al., 1996; Wilman and Riley, 1993).The high successful classification rate of perennial ryegrass would suggest that the spectra of this species is more distinct than the either Italian or hybrid ryegrass. However there was a low level of successful classification between Italian and hybrid ryegrass samples. Hybrid ryegrass varieties are artificially bred through the combination of genetic material from both perennial and Italian parentage (Jones and Humphreys, 1993). The aim is to combine the beneficial agronomic traits of each parentage, and these traits are differential displayed in the progeny (Gilliland and Mann, 2001). It may be the case that the chemical composition traits of the Italian parentage are more prevalent in the hybrid progeny in this dataset, and is a potential explanation for the misclassification between Italian and hybrid samples.
In this study Italian and hybrid plots were sown in an individual trial with perennial ryegrass plots sown in a separate trial. Although these trials were within 500 m of each other and had a similar previous cropping history, the micro-environmental and soil effects may have influenced the low level of classification between Italian and hybrid. These differences may partly explain why the discriminant model could successful classify perennial ryegrass samples but high levels of misclassification occurred between the Italian and hybrid ryegrass samples. It is therefore difficult to ascertain due if the differences in the discriminant model is caused by these management factors or differences in the chemical composition between species. A future study could allow for these confounding effects and with a range in hybrid ryegrass varieties, whose parentage is know would allow for some interesting findings.
8.4.2	Ploidy
Tetraploid varieties often have higher WSC concentration and digestibility values (Balocchi and Lopez, 2009; Smith, et al., 2001) and are associated with lower ADF and NDF values. Each of these traits has a spectral peak associated with it in the NIR region (Deaville and Flinn, 2000). These could potentially be utilized to disciminant between diploid and tetraploid samples. However there is no distinct separation between the chemical composition traits of diploid and tetraploid varieties, with (Gilliland, et al., 2002) reporting an overlap between the highest diploid varieties and the lowest tetraploid varieties for digestibility and WSC concentration. If these factors were associated with discriminating between ploidy groups it could account for some of the misclassification.
8.4.3	Maturity
The three maturity groups are artificial classifications within a continuum in nature (Gilliland, et al., 2002) and evaluations schemes are designed to compare intrinsic differences between varieties, so cutting dates are targeted to minimise the effects of maturity. The high accuracy of the discriminant model is therefore surprising, however is not unexpected that when misclassification occurs it tends to be to the adjacent group(s). The range in heading dates within a maturity group is larger than the range between groups (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). Assessing the heading date of the varieties used for this discriminant model (Dataset B) shows that the differences within groups (range of 7, 12, 8 days for early, intermediate and late respectively) was larger than the smallest differences between heading dates between adjacent groups (3 days between early and intermediate and less than 1 day between intermediate and late). 
The success of the discriminant model for maturity may be considered surprising given these maturity groups are artificial points in a continuum (Gilliland, et al., 2002). However, Stewart and Hayes (2010) report that in the UK there is a tendency for the breeding of new varieties to cross genetic material from within maturity groups. Therefore there is the potential for some traits to be more prevalent within maturity groups that could potentially be used to discriminant between the maturity groups. 
8.4.4	Age of sward
The process of reseeding the sward has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the soil structure and fertility that improves the nutritive quality and productivity of swards (Hopkins, et al., 1995a; Parsons, et al., 2011). This will contribute to differences in the spectra between one and two year old swards and contribute to the high level of success rate of the age of sward discriminant model. 
The harvest year 2007 was the only calendar year with both one and two year old swards present and the discriminant model was able to successful discriminate between the two ages in this calendar year. As other comparisons between one- and two- year old sward occurred in different calendar years it is likely that the weather could potential be accounting for the discriminating of age of sward. However the similar level of classification in the harvest year 2007 (where both one- and two- year old swards were present) to the other age of sward comparisons would suggest that the discriminant model is able to detect intrinsic differences between the one and two year old swards.
8.4.5	Harvest year
Differences in harvest year are mainly due to prevailing weather conditions. These are well established to influence the productivity and chemical composition of grass swards (Knight, et al., 1996; Roche, et al., 2009). These conditions are variable both between and within calendar years, thus each harvest year will have a unique weather pattern that influences the chemical composition of the sward and thus provides the basis for discriminanting between harvest years. Although no all plots were sown in the same year so another contributory factor may be the environmental conditions in the year of sowing.
The harvest year 2003 had a 100 % classification rate, with no false positives. This would suggest that the weather in that harvest year was unique, within this dataset. The harvest year 2003 was a particularly warm year, recording the highest maximum temperature between 2001 -2009 in July and the second highest in June and August. This year was also 19 % below the average rainfall with 20 % of this rainfall occurring in October (Weather data - Chapter 3). The inclusion of additional harvest years in which the weather conditions are similar to year(s) already present may test the discriminating power of these models.
8.4.6	Cut
As the sward progresses through the growing season there is an alteration in the development stage of the sward that influences its chemical composition and productivity (Beever, et al., 2000). Prevailing weather conditions change throughout the year and have a tendency to follow similar patterns throughout the year. There is an increase in solar radiation and daylight hours from January onwards with a peak in the summer months and this gradually declines towards December (Chapter 3). Although following similar trends, the weather conditions in Ireland can be highly variable within certain years and low temperatures not uncommon in summer months with incidences of heavy rainfall potentially occurring in any month (Chapter 3).
Cut 1 had a 100 % successful classification rate and only two false positive predictions both of which were from Cut 6. Cut 1 occurs after an over-wintering period of little growth (Brereton and Mcgilloway, 1999; Han, et al., 2003) in which the sward is of high digestibility and WSC concentration and lower proportion of cellular wall material (Beever, et al., 2000). These differences could account for the high classification rate and low level of false positives. The discriminant model had the second highest successful classification rate for Cut 2. The date of Cut 2 is near the heading date of the varieties, which is a distinct developmental stage of the sward when the grass plants undergo developmental changes that are associated with reproductive growth (Aldrich and Dend, 1963). Secondary heading is known to occur in late summer, that coincides with the date of Cut 3, whereby some of the sward develop seed heads for a second time (Laidlaw, 2004) and would therefore be in a similar development stage as Cut 2. This may explain why majority of misclassified samples from Cut 2 were misclassified as Cut 3. From all other harvests within a year the highest proportion of misclassification occurred to adjacent cuts. This is not surprising as these are likely to be more similar in developmental stage and influenced by common prevailing weather conditions than cuts taken from an extended time range.
8.4.7	Variety
Miralbés (2008) developed discriminant models that could successful identify 12 winter wheat varieties with 94% accuracy. These results are in contrast to the current study where classification rate for variety was lowest of all the discriminant models. However, winter wheat is annual crop that is harvested once per growing cycle whereas discriminating perennial ryegrass varieties is further complicated as it is a perennial crop that is harvested over several years and throughout a growing season (Camlin, 1997). Thus discrimination between perennial ryegrass varieties is confounded the age of sward and development stage and also interactions with environmental conditions. 
AberCraigs was the variety with the highest successful classification rate within the variety dicriminant model. AberCraigs is a variety that has been selectively bred for increased WSC concentration (Hume, et al., 2010) and the 2100 nm region is associated with carbohydrates (Deaville and Flinn, 2000) that could potentially be a factor in discriminating this variety. However this high level of successful classification was coupled with a high level of false positives. 
There was some little evidence of a push-pull effect, whereby misclassification tended to occur between two verities. For example, 44 % (36) of the misclassified Greengold samples were incorrectly classified as Magician and 31 % of actual Magican spectra misclassified as Greengold. However this was not always the case of the misclassified Tyrone spectra, 47 (36 %) of these were incorrectly classified as Cancan. The reserve trend only had 2 (9 %) Cancan samples misclassified as Tyrone. 
Misclassification more often tended to occur between similar ploidy and maturity groups. For example Gilford is a late-heading diploid and 51 % (44) of the misclassified samples were incorrectly classified as Cancan, also a late-heading diploid. Tyrone, also a late-heading diploid had a total of 130 misclassified spectra, 57 % (74) of these were misclassified as other late-heading diploid varieties. All bar 7 samples (5 %) were not misclassified as either late-heading or tetraploids. 
A strategy to improve the accuracy of the discriminant model would be to sample grass varieties at a similar morphological stage, such as heading date, which will minimize the effects developmental stage and varietal differences are likely to be pronounced at this stage.
8.5	Conclusions
This study has displayed the potential of NIRS discriminant models to successful characterise between groups of ryegrasses from within a population. As the spectra contain information on several aspects of the chemical composition of a sample it is likely that these are the factors driving the classification. However, it was not always clear if intrinsic differences between the groups were the only factor in the successful discriminant models as confounding effects of management and environmental conditions were also present. A future study in which all groups are sown within an individual trial, under the same cutting and fertilizer regime would minimize the confounding micro-environmental effects and the majority of the differences could be accounted for by differences between groups. 
The casual factors driving the differences in the chemical composition, and thus spectra, are likely to differ for each discriminant model. The key factors could be environmental (e.g. soil and weather) and plant tissue. A degree of overlap occurred between all groups and was particularly prevalent in the comparison of individual perennial ryegrass varieties. It was noted that a high success rate was achieved for AberCraigs, a variety bred for increased WSC concentration. Where such specific traits attributes are present and are of a type that are likely to occur in the spectra (such as increased WSC concentration) that discriminant models may be able to detect.
In conclusion, the use of NIRS for developing discriminant models has the potential and rapidly classification ryegrass samples with a high degree of accuracy within a population. Applying these models to samples from outside this population has several potential applications but would require a validation to ensure the accuracy is maintained when variation outside the current calibration set is applied to the current discriminant models.

CHAPTER 9


9	GENERAL DISCUSSION
 
9.1	NIRS calibration models
All other calibration models examined from the literature, with the exception of Decruyenaere, et al. (2009b), had a much smaller calibration set (n = 56 – 195). Thus the high level of accuracy of the current calibration models, given the range in genotypes, weather, tissue, species and nutritive traits is a considerable achievement.
The calibration set (n = 2056) for developing NIRS calibration models to assess the nutritive and ensilability quality of ryegrass swards (Table 4.1) comprised samples from five harvest years and was based on 176 different ryegrass varieties. Thus each of the calibration models incorporated a wide range of growing conditions, species, plant genotypes and tissue development stages relevant to ryegrass variety evaluation at this one site. The calibration set is thus likely to be a robust representation of the potential variation these calibration models are expected to experience in analysing grass samples from additional sowings. However it is acknowledged that the weather conditions in future harvest years and/or the addition of new genotypes for analysis may contain samples outside the variation contained within this calibration set and further laboratory analysis of specific outliers will be needed to update these models (Smith and Kearney, 2000).
The national variety evaluation scheme assesses nutritive quality at one site; Backwestion, Co. Kildare (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). Therefore all samples for the calibration set were obtained from this site. The evaluation of herbage yield occurs at five sites throughout Ireland to account for the variation in environmental conditions experienced throughout the country (Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). If the scope of the calibration models were to be expanded to include these additional locations, then the ability of the calibration models to encompass the additional variation associated with these locations would need to be assessed within the model. As Smith and Kearney (2000) demonstrated, a bias between two locations for analysing nutritive quality using NIRS calibration models can be accommodated but to achieve optimal accuracy can require separate calibration models for each location.
The comparison of three different calibration approaches (global, species-specific and local) established that for all nutritive traits the local calibration approach had the lowest accuracy (Table 4.3). Overall a global approach was more accurate than the weighted average of the individual species-specific models, however it is noted that some of the species-specific models were of a higher accuracy than their respective global model. As the global models maintained a high accuracy for analysing all species and nutritive quality traits, combined with the ease of use and maintenance of global calibration models these were recommended for the analysis of nutritive and ensilability quality traits.
9.1.1	Outlier detection
When calibration models are applied to samples from outside the calibration set, an important practical concern is the detection of outliers, whose estimates may be unreliable as they fall outside the range and variation of the calibration set. Shenk and Westerhaus (1991b) proposed the detection of outliers based on their spectral properties. This was carried out using mahalanobis distance (gH). All spectra from the calibration set are broken down to principle components to provide structure and order to the data. The distance the principle components of each spectrum is from the centre of the calibration set is calculated. The average distance of the spectra is defined as 1.0 and spectra greater than gH 3.0 are defined as outliers by Shenk and Westerhaus (1991b). However the gH 3.0 distance is an arbitrary figure and was established as a balance between including extreme samples and removing true outliers. Caution must be used when using this value, as the current calibration set is quite large in comparison to other previously published calibration models. It is likely that the range in principle component figures from this dataset will be much higher than from a smaller calibration set. Thus, a gH of 3.0 from the current calibration set is likely to be larger than from the numerous smaller datasets found in the literature. Further evaluation of the malahonbias distance is required prior to any recommendation of the optimal gH required for the balance between identifying true outliers and samples outside the variation of the calibration set.
9.1.2	Time and cost savings
The discipline of conducting variety comparative trials for official statutory national variety evaluation and also recommended list services for the seed industry and the farming sector have fixed annual reporting cycles (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010). As the test periods in these systems are long, often five or more years it is important to be able to provide results and variety listing decisions as close to the end of the growing season as practical. Thus data on nutritive quality must be produced within tight time constraints. If all samples from each cut, block, sowing and age of sward require assessment, there will be a requirement for thousands of samples to undergo quality analysis per reporting cycle. The time required for in vitro DMD laboratory techniques to analyse, for example, a batch of ~180 ryegrass samples is a minimum of five working days for one person. Using the laboratory technique the in vitro DMD analyses would require at least 23 weeks analysing all the samples from Backweston trials for one reporting cycle. NIRS can process ~100 samples per day, which would require just over eight weeks to analyse the same number of samples. NIRS also has the added benefit of being able to analysis multiple quality traits simultaneously (Foley, et al., 1998), thus saving on workload as several laboratory techniques, one for each quality trait, are not required to be carried out in independently. This is a considerable time saving and enables quality traits to be rapidly analysed within the tight time restraints for recommended list publication. An added benefit is that simultaneous analysis of multiple traits by NIRS is carried out by one operator so there is also a reduction in the reliance on staff which can free up resources for other priorities. 
An additional benefit of NIRS is the lack of chemical reagents required compared with the laboratory techniques, which again greatly reduces costs. This means NIRS can also be considered a ‘Green and Clean’ technology (Armenta, et al., 2008) which has been indentified in Food Harvest 2020 as being an important issue to promoting the sustainability of Irish agriculture. 
9.2	Productivity and quality of ryegrasses
The herbage yield of Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards was an additional 21 % in the first harvest year and 18 % in the second harvest year over perennial ryegrass swards. This would convey a significant advantage providing additional forage to ruminants. However it has been established that the Italian and hybrid ryegrass swards have a lower persistence under grazing (Camlin, 1997). Under silage production management, however, their productivity can be maintained over a longer period, as shown in variety trials by Gilliland and Mann (2001) over a five year period. This is likely to be more clearly expressed under the current combined simulated grazing and conservation management system used in this study. Given the higher densities and open growth of Italian ryegrass, only the hybrid varieties are likely to achieve this on farm due to the pressure associated with machinery.
Perennial ryegrass swards had a larger herbage yield in their first harvest year than second harvest year. It is unclear whether this was the effect of younger swards or the beneficial effect of re-sowing on the nutrient availability in the soil. Tetraploid varieties on average had a higher in vitro DMD and WSC concentration than diploid varieties which will likely convey increased animal production values. 
9.2.1	Persistence 
The persistence of the sward is essential for considering the long term production potential of ryegrass swards (Camlin, 1997). Although this was not measured in the current study, national variety evaluation schemes report a persistence figure. This is usually a ground cover score after 2-3 years of simulated grazing. However the mechanical harvesting of trials does not accurately reflect grazing dynamics (Di, et al., 2001; Hopkins, 2000). Treading by grazing animals provides an additional stress on the sward and Di, et al. (2001) reported a 9 % reduction in herbage yield when swards where subjected to mechanical treading. This mechanical treading may offer a more reliable representation of the grazing conditions; however this will only account for treading and not biting mechanics which are an additional stress to the sward (Hopkins, 2000).
9.2.2	Biological significance
Although differences in this research have been reported on a statistically significant basis, any changes in nutritive quality need to be extrapolated to the animal interface to determine their true value to ruminant enterprises. Small increases in digestibility can be valuable as they can have a beneficial effect on grass intake and energy availability from the sward (Casler, 2000; Coleman, et al., 2010; Wilkins and Humphreys, 2003), with a 3.2 % increase in beef production being reported per 1 % increase in digestibility (Casler and Vogel, 1999). The required scale of increase in WSC concentration is less clear as Miller, et al. (2001) found that 40 g WSC/kg DM provided increased milk production and quality, while Taweel, et al. (2005) found no benefit in milk production or quality when heifers were fed a perennial ryegrass variety with increased WSC concentration (24 - 31 g WSC /kg DM greater than control). A complicating factor as reported by Parsons, et al. (2011) is that increases in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are dependent on the ratio of energy (in form of WSC) to nitrogen (including CP sources). Although this is a continuum, the response in which any increase in WSC concentration will lead to an increase in NUE, that is detectable in field trails, requires a substantial increase in WSC concentration due to the relatively high levels of CP concentration amongst perennial ryegrass. In the current study the largest difference between ploidy groups was reported at the ‘Spring’ period when tetraploids had 22 g/kg DM higher WSC than diploids. Nonetheless, there was a maximum range of 90 g/kg DM in annual WSC concentrations between individual perennial ryegrass varieties (data not presented) representing the difference between the worst and elite performing varieties. This scale of differences would be expected to confer significant animal production benefits. As the nutritive quality differences between maturity and age of sward, and particularly between species and ploidies, were sufficiently large to affect animal productivity and efficiency this justifies selection from one of these groups to match the sward productivity and quality profile with ruminant requirements.
Other research has also shown that within each of the groups analysed (i.e. species, maturity group and ploidy within perennial ryegrass) there is a range in productivity and quality traits (Chaves, et al., 2010; Frame, 1991; Laidlaw, 2004). End-users are also justified in selecting varieties from within a specific group to get the performance profile that suits their individual farming enterprise.
9.2.3	Relationships between quality traits
It is well established that nutritive quality traits are interlinked and have numerous relationships and interactions. For example, an increased WSC concentration has been shown to increase the amount of readily available carbohydrates which increase the digestibility of the swards (Humphreys, 1989c). However, an increase in WSC concentration has been linked with a lower CP concentration through altering the partitioning of carbon to favour carbohydrate production (Humphreys, 1989c; Smith, et al., 2002). The relationships and interactions between nutritive quality traits are an important consideration for evaluation schemes and breeding programs, as an increased value in one trait may be partially accountable for the response in another trait.
It has been established that as the sward increases in maturity towards reproductive development there is an increase in herbage DM production and decrease in digestibility (Aldrich and Dend, 1963; Frame, 1991). To minimise the effect of maturity for varietal comparison, variety evaluation schemes for perennial ryegrass harvest varieties within three separate maturity categories (Gilliland and Gensollen, 2010; Grogan and Gilliland, 2011). However this is no simple matter as even within maturity categories there is a range in heading date, which will result in the cutting schedule favouring the relative performance of some varieties over others. Humphreys and O'kiely (2006) reported that to manage swards to achieve similar herbage yield to intermediate-heading varieties, the cutting of late-heading varieties would need to be delayed by 8 days. However the authors reported that late-heading varieties could be harvested up to 30 days later while maintaining a similar or greater in vitro OMD. This highlights some of the difficulties facing variety evaluation schemes as the management imposed will influence productivity and nutritive quality traits. The responses, however, will not be identical for each trait or variety, therefore the management practise imposed may penalise the performance of some varieties.
9.2.4	Nitrogen application rates
The nitrogen application rates from the current study were high (350 – 400 kg N/ha per annum) in comparison to the average rate of nitrogen application on Irish farms (dairy farms - 159 kg N/ha and beef systems - 44 kg N/ha (Coulter, et al., 2005)). The nitrogen application rate is much higher on recommended list trials to reflect the lack of recycling of nitrogen, that occurs during grazing through urine excretion (Peyraud and Astigarraga, 1998). When this recycled nitrogen is accounted for, the differences in nitrogen levels between on-farm and evaluation trials are greatly reduced. Nonetheless, the intention of variety comparative trials is to accentuate differences between varieties and identify those that render the greatest potential for ruminant-based production systems in as short a test period as possible. Hence, higher nitrogen fertilizer rates are favoured and there is an assumption that there is no significant interaction between varietal ranking and the applied nitrogen rate. This is an essential assumption as if varietal ranking were sensitive to nitrogen levels it would not be possible to extrapolate results from evaluation schemes to farming-enterprises where the nitrogen application rate varies (Coulter, et al., 2005).
The increased price of N fertilizer has caused a trend for the decreased application of N fertilizer on Irish farms. Thus, ryegrass species and varieties at lower N application rates to reflect these management practises. This will have important implications as nitrogen uptake mechanisms and the optimal use of nitrogen of individual varieties and species may become an important factor that have been disguised at the current high levels of nitrogen application. At the lower levels of N application the optimal use of nitrogen by the ruminant would also be an increased priority and this could be achieved through increased NUE by as an optimal balance of WSC:CP in the sward (Parsons, et al., 2011).
9.3	Sampling protocol
The evaluation of varieties over several environments enables assessment of the stability of varieties across environments, whereby the performance of some varieties may be ‘broad-based’ (i.e. they perform reasonably well across a number of environments) and the satisfactory performance of others may be specific to certain environmental conditions (Smith, et al., 2005).
Although the presence of such interactions may seem confounding to the evaluation of varieties, Casler (1999) reports that the presence of cross-over interactions (e.g. re-ranking) suggests that varietal evaluation has likely occurred over a broader range of environmental conditions than if there were little or no re-ranking.
The implementation of an optimal sampling procedure for the nutritive quality traits is a trade-off between cost and accuracy. A sampling procedure that uses all available data (e.g. block, cuts, sowings, harvests) provides the most reliable estimate of the relative genetic merit of perennial ryegrass varieties. A confounding factor in designing a protocol is the optimal procedure was not identical for all traits, thus decisions need to be made on the priority of traits.
Variety evaluation schemes report nutritive quality traits on an annual basis as an average of all individual harvests (Dafm, 2012; Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). An additional selection criteria not assessed in the current study is the effect of cuts on the definitive ranking. If included this would enable the optimal selection of sowings (3), age of sward (2), cuts (6) and blocks (4) for an acceptable threshold. Possible strategies include dropping of cut(s) and/or bulking of cuts. This could result in a considerable time and cost saving for variety evaluation trials.
9.4	Potential benefit
The application of NIRS calibration models facilitates the inclusion of nutritive and ensilability quality traits into the recommended list trials due to considerable time and cost savings. An optimal sampling protocol will further enhance this benefit, enabling resources to be used for the evaluation of additional species, varieties or nutritive traits. The increased productivity and seasonality of swards sown with recommended varieties will decrease the reliance on expensive concentrates and conservation practises. This also enables animals to graze in marginal months of the grazing season which is of potential welfare benefit to the animal (O'donovan, et al., 2011). These factors contribute to a lower carbon footprint of Irish grass-based production systems per productivity unit, contributing to sustainable and profitable farming enterprises. The increased nutritive quality of the sward will directly increase animal productivity through more energy readily available to animals. It will also confer increased NUE by the ruminant through the optimal balance of energy (in the form of sugar) to nitrogen (in the form of protein) which results in less dependence on nitrogen fertilizer to increase the protein content of the sward (Parsons, et al., 2011). It will also decrease the nitrogen losses through urine which contribute to less nitrogen run-off (Miller, et al., 2001; Parsons, et al., 2011), reducing the potential environmental risk of eutrophication. In addition NIRS is a ‘Green and Clean’ technology (Armenta, et al., 2008) that has reduced the reliance on chemical and reagents as well as conferring a cost and time saving benefit further promoting the green credentials of this research.
These benefits contribute to a more environmental friendly and sustainable agricultural approach, which is a key goal of the industry, as well as increasing the productivity and efficiency of individual farming enterprises resulting in increased profitability for the individual.
9.5	Future work
9.5.1	Two-stage calibration models
Research from this thesis has demonstrated highly accurate NIRS calibration models for both quantitative (Chapter 4) and discriminant (Chapter 8) analysis. A potential application of these techniques would be to combine the discriminant and quantitative calibration models to create a two-stage calibration approach that could potentially increase the accuracy of the output (John, et al., 2007). The initial stage would be the use of a discriminant model to classify the group to which the spectra belonged. Subsequently, the most accurate quantitative calibration models could be applied to the spectra, based on the group as assigned by the discriminant model.
A relevant example for this two-stage approach would be for analysing the nutritive quality of a number of ryegrass species. Although a global strategy was selected, as it was accurate overall quality traits and species, it is noted that for some nutritive quality traits, the species specific strategy was more accurate than the global strategy (e.g. Italian and hybrid ryegrass for in vitro DMD). However the requirement to assign different calibration strategies for each nutritive quality or ensilability trait is likely to be prohibitive for routine analysis. The NIRS discriminant model for species was highly successful for classifying perennial and Italian ryegrass samples (82- 96 %), which could potentially allocate the most accurate calibration models without the requirement to manually assign samples to calibration models. As discriminant and qualitative models are based on the spectra of a sample this would not require any additional resources and a negligible increase in the time required for analysis.
9.5.2	NIRS calibration models for additional factors 
The objective of this research was to focus on developing NIRS calibration models to assess the nutritive and ensilability quality traits of the ryegrass varieties. However NIRS also has the potential to assess additional factors (e.g. intake potential, sward composition) based on the spectra of the sward that have important implications for the practical management and agronomic value of the sward.
9.5.2.1	Intake potential 
The ability of ruminants to ingest forage is one of the main constraints limiting animal productivity in grass-based production systems (Allen, 1996; Decruyenaere, et al., 2009a). The assessment of intake potential is unfeasible for national variety evaluation schemes due to the replication required to account for the variation between animals and the high cost of grazing trials (Camlin, 1997). NIRS calibration models have been demonstrated to predict the short-term intake rate of perennial ryegrass swards. with a 14 % standard error of mean. based on the spectra of the forage (Agnew, et al., 2004). The calibration models of Agnew, et al. (2004) looked at the short-term intake rates (1 hour), however, it is likely that long term intake potential will be more influenced by chemical composition (such as DMD) than short term intake potential, as the chemical composition influences the retention time of rumination (Baumont, et al., 2000). Chemical composition traits are the likely factors in the spectra that are relating the spectra of a forage sample to the intake values. Therefore developing NIRS calibration models using longer-term assessments of intake potential, such as the n-alkanes technique (Dillon and Stakelum, 1988), may provide a better tool for developing calibration models for assessing the intake potential of perennial ryegrass varieties.
An NIRS calibration model for assessing intake potential offers the potential to assess the intake potential of perennial ryegrass varieties without the requirement for animals on a routine basis. However, intake potential is a combination of plant and animal factors, thus by definition there is a limitation to assessing the intake potential of a forage based on the spectra on that forage alone (Dixon and Coates, 2009). 
Developing such calibrations must also address an impediment, as the management of the grazing trials that create the calibration set and the management of a variety evaluation scheme that uses mechanical harvesting will be fundamentally different. The use of grazing animals may potentially induce a bias between the calibration set and the samples from mechanically harvested plots that may be difficult to account for. Thus, there is the need for a robust validation to ensure the results from mechanically harvested plots match those with grazing animals. A split plot design whereby the main plot is grazed versus non-grazed and the sub-plot of grass varieties would enable a number of conclusions to be drawn. This would make it possible to determine if the spectra of the different managements were significantly different based on mahalanobis distance (Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991b). An assessment of nutritive quality traits could also be made, as the nutritive traits are likely to be contributing to the forage element of intake potential (Decruyenaere, et al., 2009a; Mertens, 2007). This would allow a comparison of the intake values, as assessed by the NIRS calibration model between grazed and non-grazed swards. However, more importantly it would also enable an assessment of the relative performance (i.e. ranking) of the intake value of individual varieties. As the goal of recommended list trials is not to assess absolute values, but the relative performance in traits of interest, if the ranking between grazed and non-grazed swards were highly correlated this could potentially be a useful tool for adding an additional trait to recommended list publications.
9.5.2.2	Sward composition
Previous research has established that NIRS has the potential to predict the sward composition in a species from a different genus (Chataigner, et al., 2010; Wachendorf, et al., 1999). The high success rate of discriminant models for species and ploidy classification (Chapter 8) would suggest that NIRS could be developed to identify the species composition of mixed swards within more closely related species. Species and ploidy groups within the genus Lolium are morphologically very similar thus making identification a complex task prone to misclassification (Roldan-Ruiz, et al., 2001). The dynamics and competitive ability of different species and ploidy groups in mixed swards is poorly understood, however these the relative proportion of each group will influence the productivity and nutritive quality of swards (Gilliland, et al., 2010; Ingram, 1997). NIRS could be developed to provide a useful tool for the measurement of species composition in mixed swards which could contribute to research on sward dynamics, with the potential to enhance productivity through transgressive overyielding (Nyfeler, et al., 2009)
9.5.3	Field Spectroscopy 
A limitation to the NIRS is that samples must be harvested and brought to the instrument. Increase in computational power and advancements in NIRS has enabled the development of portable NIRS instrumentation that can be brought to the sample (Biewer, et al., 2009). This has a number of potential applications including the real time non-destructive analysis of forages, allowing rapid decisions to be taken regarding the management of swards for grazing or conservation. It also further augments the speed of NIRS, as samples can be analysed in field without the requirement of taking a sub-sample into the laboratory. 
Feuerstein and Paul (2007) have assessed the use on on-board NIRS instrumentation for analysing the DM concentration of grass samples and reported a decrease in the time needed per plot while using on-board NIRS in comparison to laboratory NIRS. They also reported that the on-board NIRS had a higher accuracy for the analysis of moisture content than oven based measurements, and at a decreased cost. However the analysis of nutritive quality was found to be less accurate and only sufficient for sorting genotypes in the early stages of breeding programs. 
9.5.4	Agronomic index
The information provided to farmers from recommended list publications contains information on seasonal production, persistence, nutritive quality and heading date on a number of species and varieties (Dafm, 2012; Gilliland and Meehan, 2011). This information can be quite complex and difficult to extrapolate to animal production values, making varietal selection to match enterprise requirements a task requiring a significant level of expertise. The use of an index(es) could provide a useful tool for amalgamating data into a more accessible format. 
As previously stated the combination of DM and WSC concentrations and buffering capacity could provide an ensilability index (Chapter 6). If a high priority of a farming enterprise was the use of ensiled grass, this index would provide an indication of the efficiency of the ensiling process and selection could be tailored for these management practises.
Mcevoy, et al. (2011) developed an economic index, that provides a monetary value (euros) to each trait, wherein the value of each trait differed depending on the seasonal period to reflect the demands from the animal. At present, nutritive quality traits are considered on an annual basis (Dafm, 2012) from all individual cuts. However the animal response may not be identical at each harvest period, thus this should be incorporated into a nutritive quality index. Similarly as climate and both stocking rate and management practises differ between farming enterprises, any index must be sufficiently flexible to account for these differing requirements. These factors make developing an index that can be widely applied in practice a complex development challenge.
9.6	Conclusions
The global calibration models developed for each of the nutritive quality and ensilability traits were within the range of values found from the literature (Table 4.2);
i	In vitro DMD had an R2 of 0.86
ii	WSC had an R2 of 0.96
iii	CP had an R2 of 0.98
iv	Buffering capacity had an R2 of 0.95
This research has shown the potential to discriminate ryegrass characteristic groups (e.g. species, ploidy, age of sward, harvest year, cut, variety) based on the NIR spectra. The discriminant models were generally highly accurate, although it is likely that the spectral properties provides information on the underlying chemical composition of the sample and these factors are used to discriminate between groups. The chemical composition, and thus spectra, is influenced by a combination of genetic, tissue and environmental factors that enable discriminantion.
The NIRS calibrations models developed in this study are of practical use for variety evaluation. Evidence of this is the fact that the DAFM recommended list trials are now using these NIRS calibration models as part of their routine variety protocol for the assessment of in vitro DMD and WSC (Dafm, 2012).
